Neglecting air resistance and assuming that the acceleration of gravity is constant, the launched object can reach 3700 km above the surface of Earth. If the object has a radius of $20$ cm and the air resistance is proportional to the square of the object's speed with $c_w = 0.2$, assuming the density of air is constant, the maximum height reached is 890 km. Including the fact that the acceleration of gravity decreases as the object soars above Earth, the height reached is 950 km.
