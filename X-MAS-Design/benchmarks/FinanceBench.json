    "query": "Answer this question: Among all of the derivative instruments that Verizon used to manage the exposure to fluctuations of foreign currencies exchange rates or interest rates, which one had the highest notional value in FY 2021? \nHere is the relevant evidence that you need to answer the question:\n[START OF FILING] Certain of our equity investments do not have readily determinable fair values and are excluded from the tables above. Such investments are \nmeasured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical \nor similar investment of the same issuer and are included in Investments in unconsolidated businesses in our consolidated balance sheets. As \nof December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the carrying amount of our investments without readily determinable fair values were \n$808 million and $402 million, respectively. During 2021, there were approximately $66 million of adjustments due to observable price \nchanges and insignificant impairment charges. Cumulative adjustments due to observable price changes and impairment charges were \napproximately $143 million and $63 million, respectively. \nVerizon has a liability for contingent consideration related to its acquisition of Tracfone, completed in November 2021. The fair value is \ncalculated using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model and represents a Level 3 measurement. Level 3 instruments include \nvaluation based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other \nmarket participants. Subsequent to the acquisition date, at each reporting date, the contingent consideration liability is remeasured to fair \nvalue with changes recorded within Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income. \nFixed income securities consist primarily of investments in municipal bonds. The valuation of the fixed income securities are based on the \nquoted prices for similar assets in active markets or identical assets in inactive markets or models that apply inputs from observable market \ndata. The valuation determines that these securities are classified as Level 2. \nDerivative contracts are valued using models based on readily observable market parameters for all substantial terms of our derivative \ncontracts and thus are classified within Level 2. We use mid-market pricing for fair value measurements of our derivative instruments. Our \nderivative instruments are recorded on a gross basis. \nWe recognize transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end of the reporting period. \nFair Value of Short-term and Long-term Debt \nThe fair value of our debt is determined using various methods, including quoted prices for identical debt instruments, which is a Level 1 \nmeasurement, as well as quoted prices for similar debt instruments with comparable terms and maturities, which is a Level 2 measurement. \nThe fair value of our short-term and long-term debt, excluding finance leases, was as follows: \nFair Value \n(dollars in millions) \nCarrying \nAmount\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal \nAt December 31, 2020\n$ \n127,778 \n$ \n103,967 \n$ \n52,785 \n$ \n $ \n156,752 \nAt December 31, 2021\n149,543 \n106,599 \n62,606 \n \n169,205 \nDerivative Instruments \nWe enter into derivative transactions primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. \nWe employ risk management strategies, which may include the use of a variety of derivatives including interest rate swaps, cross currency \nswaps, forward starting interest rate swaps, treasury rate locks, interest rate caps, swaptions and foreign exchange forwards.

In September 2022, we settled a previously disclosed investigation by the Securities and\nExchange Commission related to the 737 MAX accidents and consented to a civil penalty, which resulted in an earnings charge of $200 that was\npaid in October 2022. We cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any, not covered by available insurance that we may incur as a result of\nany remaining pending lawsuits or other matters related to the accidents and the 737 MAX.\nDuring 2019, we entered into agreements with Embraer S.A. (Embraer) to establish joint ventures that included the commercial aircraft and\nservices operations of Embraer, of which we were expected to acquire an 80 percent ownership stake for $4,200, as well as a joint venture to\npromote and develop new markets for the C-390 Millennium. In 2020, we exercised our contractual right to terminate these agreements based\non Embraers failure to meet certain required closing conditions. Embraer has disputed our right to terminate the agreements, and the dispute is\ncurrently in arbitration. We cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any, that may result from the arbitration, which we currently expect to\nbe completed in late 2023 or early 2024.\nNote 22 Segment and Revenue Information\nOur primary profitability measurements to review a segments operating results are Earnings/(loss) from operations and operating margins. We\noperate in four reportable segments: BCA, BDS, BGS and BCC. All other activities fall within Unallocated items, eliminations and other. See\npage 58 for the Summary of Business Segment Data, which is an integral part of this note.\nBCA develops, produces and markets commercial jet aircraft principally to the commercial airline industry worldwide. Revenue on commercial\naircraft contracts is recognized at the point in time when an aircraft is completed and accepted by the customer.\nBDS engages in the research, development, production and modification of the following products and related services: manned and unmanned\nmilitary aircraft and weapons systems, surveillance and engagement, strategic defense and intelligence systems, satellite systems and space\nexploration. BDS revenue is generally recognized over the contract term (over time) as costs are incurred.\nBGS provides parts, maintenance, modifications, logistics support, training, data analytics and information-based services to commercial and\ngovernment customers worldwide. BGS segment revenue and costs include certain products and services provided to other segments. Revenue\non commercial spare parts contracts is recognized at the point in time when a spare part is delivered to the customer.

The acquisition is part of the Company's Flexibles reportable segment and resulted in the recognition of acquired\nidentifiable net assets of $9 million and goodwill of $36 million. Goodwill is deductible for tax purposes. The fair values of the contingent\nconsideration, identifiable net assets acquired, and goodwill are based on the Company's best estimate as of June 30, 2023, and are considered\npreliminary. The Company aims to complete the purchase price allocation as soon as practicable but no later than one year from the date of the\nacquisition.\n The fair value estimates for all three acquisitions were based on income, market, and cost valuation methods. Pro forma information related to\nthese acquisitions has not been presented, as the effect of the acquisitions on the Company's consolidated financial statements was not material.\nDisposal of Russian business\n On December 23, 2022, the Company completed the sale of its Russian business after receiving all necessary regulatory approvals and cash\nproceeds, including receipt of closing cash balances. The sale follows the Companys previously announced plan to pursue the orderly sale of its\nRussian business. The total net cash consideration received, excluding disposed cash and items settled net, was $365 million and resulted in a\npre-tax net gain of $215 million. The carrying value of the Russian business had previously been impaired by $90 million in the quarter ended\nJune 30, 2022. The impairment charge was based on the Company's best estimate of the fair value of its Russian business, which considered the\nwide range of indicative bids received and uncertain regulatory environment. The net pre-tax gain on disposal of the Russian business has been\nrecorded as restructuring, impairment, and other related activities, net within the consolidated statements of income. The Russian business had a\nnet carrying value of $252 million, including allocated goodwill of $46 million and accumulated other comprehensive losses of $73 million,\nprimarily attributed to foreign currency translation adjustments.\nYear ended June 30, 2022\n During the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, the Company completed the disposal of non-core assets in the Flexibles reporting segment. The\nCompany recorded an expense of $10 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, to adjust the long-lived assets to their fair value less\ncost to sell.\n64\n [END OF FILING]",

Although such transactions are excluded \nfrom the business segment results, they are included in reported consolidated earnings. Gains and losses from these \ntransactions that are not individually significant are included in segment results as these items are included in the chief operating \ndecision makers assessment of segment performance. See \"Consolidated Results of Operations\" for additional information \nregarding Corporate and other results. \nCapital Expenditures and Investments \nWe continue to invest in our wireless networks, high-speed fiber and other advanced technologies to position ourselves at the \ncenter of growth trends for the future. During the year ended December 31, 2022, these investments included $23.1 billion for \ncapital expenditures, inclusive of approximately $6.2 billion in C-Band related capital expenditures. See \"Cash Flows Used in \nInvesting Activities\" and \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" for additional information. We believe that our investments aimed at \nexpanding our portfolio of products and services will provide our customers with an efficient, reliable infrastructure for competing \nin the information economy. \nGlobal Network and Technology \nWe are focusing our capital spending on adding capacity and density to our 4G Long-Term Evolution (LTE) network, while also \nbuilding our next generation 5G network. We are densifying our networks by utilizing small cell technology, in-building solutions \nand distributed antenna systems. Network densification enables us to add capacity to address increasing mobile video \nconsumption and the growing demand for IoT products and services on our 4G LTE and 5G networks. Over the past several \nyears, we have been leading the development of 5G wireless technology industry standards and the ecosystems for fixed and \nmobile 5G wireless services. 5G technology enables higher throughput and lower latency than the 4G LTE technology and allows \nour networks to handle more traffic as the number of internet-connected devices grows. In January 2022, we began deploying C-\nBand spectrum, which has been built out to cover approximately 189 million POPs in the U.S. as of December 31, 2022. We \nexpect to continue deploying C-Band spectrum across the continental U.S. as more and more of the spectrum becomes \navailable for our use. We use low and mid-band spectrum and dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) technology, to allow 5G service \nto run simultaneously with 4G LTE on multiple spectrum bands. With DSS, whenever customers move outside Verizons \nmillimeter wave and C-Band coverage areas, their 5G-enabled devices will remain on 5G technology using the lower spectrum \nbands where this network is available. This allows us to more fully and effectively utilize our current spectrum resources to serve \nboth 4G and 5G customers. \nTo compensate for the shrinking market for traditional copper-based products, we continue to build fiber-based networks \nsupporting data, video and advanced business services - areas where demand for reliable high-speed connections is growing. \nWe are transforming the architecture of our networks into our Intelligent Edge Network, providing improved efficiency and \nvirtualization, increased automation and opportunities for edge computing services that will support our fiber-based and radio \naccess network technologies. We expect that this new architecture will simplify operations by eliminating legacy network \nelements, speed the deployment of 5G wireless technology and create new opportunities in the business market in a cost-\nefficient manner. \nConsolidated Results of Operations \nIn this section, we discuss our overall results of operations and highlight special items that are not included in our segment \nresults. In \"Segment Results of Operations,\" we review the performance of our two reportable segments in more detail. A detailed \ndiscussion of 2020 items and year-over-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020 that are not included in this Form 10-K can \nbe found in the \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our Annual Report \non Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. \nConsolidated Operating Revenues \n(dollars in millions) \nIncrease/(Decrease) \nYears Ended December 31,\n2022\n2021 \n2022 vs. 2021 \nConsumer\n$ 103,506 \n$ 95,300 $ \n8,206 \n 8.6 % \nBusiness\n31,072 \n31,042 \n30 \n 0.1 \nCorporate and other\n2,510 \n7,722 \n(5,212) \n (67.5) \nEliminations\n(253)\n(451)\n198 \n 43.9 \nConsolidated Operating Revenues\n$ 136,835 \n$ 133,613 $ \n3,222 \n 2.4 \nConsolidated operating revenues increased during 2022 compared to 2021, due to increases in our Consumer and Business \nsegments, partially offset by a decrease in Corporate and other. \n 23 \n Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n [END OF FILING]",

This new program authorizes the\nrepurchase of up to $10 billion of 3Ms outstanding common stock, with no pre-established end date. In the first six months of 2023, the Company purchased $29 million of its\nown stock, compared to $773 million of stock purchases in the first six months of 2022. As of June 30, 2023, approximately $4.2 billion remained available under the\nauthorization. In February 2023, 3Ms Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2023 dividend of $1.50 per share, an increase of 1 percent. This marked the 65th consecutive\nyear of dividend increases for 3M. In May 2023, 3M's Board of Directors declared a second-quarter 2023 dividend of $1.50 per share.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Sales:\nRefer to the preceding Overview section and the Performance by Business Segment section later in MD&A for additional discussion of sales change.\nOperating Expenses:\nThree months ended\nJune 30,\nSix months ended\nJune 30,\n(Percent of net sales)\n2023\n2022\nChange\n2023\n2022\nChange\nCost of sales\n55.3 %\n58.5 %\n(3.2)%\n56.4 %\n56.6 %\n(0.2)%\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A)\n146.6 \n34.7 \n111.9 \n85.0 \n27.9 \n57.1 \nResearch, development and related expenses (R&D)\n5.7 \n5.5 \n0.2 \n5.8 \n5.5 \n0.3 \nOperating income (loss) margin\n(107.6)%\n1.3 %\n(108.9)%\n(47.2)%\n10.0 %\n(57.2)%\nStock compensation expense was $41 million and $47 million for the second quarter of 2023 and 2022, respectively, and was $176 million and $182 million for the six months\nended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which impacts cost of sales; selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A); and research, development and related expenses\n(R&D). The Companys annual stock option and restricted stock unit grant is made in February. Accounting rules require recognition of expense under a non-substantive\nvesting period approach, requiring compensation expense recognition when an employee is eligible to retire. This retiree-eligible population represents 35 percent of the annual\ngrant stock-based compensation expense; therefore, higher stock-based compensation expense is recognized in the first quarter each year.\n3M expects global defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense in 2023 to decrease by approximately $160 million pre-tax when compared to 2022, which\nimpacts cost of sales, SG&A, and R&D. The year-on-year decrease in defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense for the second quarter and first six\nmonths of 2023 was approximately $38 million and $80 million, respectively.\nFor total year 2022, the Company recognized consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement service cost expense of $426 million and a benefit of $248\nmillion related to all non-service pension and postretirement net benefit costs (after settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) for a total consolidated\ndefined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement expense of $178 million.\nFor total year 2023, defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense is anticipated to total approximately $270 million while non-service pension and\npostretirement net benefit cost is anticipated to be a benefit of approximately $125 million, for a total consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement expense\nof approximately $145 million, a decrease in expense of approximately $30 million compared to 2022.\nThe Company is continuing the ongoing deployment of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system on a worldwide basis, with these investments impacting cost of sales,\nSG&A, and R&D.\nCost of Sales:\nCost of sales, measured as a percent of sales, decreased in the second quarter and first six months of 2023 when compared to the same period last year. Decreases were\nprimarily due to lower year-on-year net costs for significant litigation to address certain PFAS-related matters at 3M's Zwijndrecht, Belgium site, higher selling prices, spending\ndiscipline and restructuring benefits. These decreases were partially offset by higher raw materials and energy costs; manufacturing productivity headwinds; investments in\ngrowth, productivity and sustainability; and restructuring charges.\n62\n [END OF FILING]",

If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why. \nHere is the relevant evidence that you need to answer the question:\n[START OF FILING] Table of Contents\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 and for\neach of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 and related notes, which are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as with the\nother sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nIntroduction\nIn this section, we will describe the general financial condition and the results of operations of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries\n(collectively, us, our or AMD), including a discussion of our results of operations for 2022 compared to 2021, an analysis of changes in our financial\ncondition and a discussion of our off-balance sheet arrangements. Discussions of 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020 that are\nnot included in this Form 10-K can be found in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of\nour Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2021.\nOverview\n2022 was a transformative year for AMD as we took several major steps that scaled and reshaped our business. In February 2022, we completed our strategic\nacquisition of Xilinx, Inc. (Xilinx) which expanded our technology and product portfolio to include adaptable hardware platforms that enable hardware\nacceleration and rapid innovation across a variety of technologies and established AMD in multiple embedded markets where we have traditionally not had a\nsignificant presence. We now offer Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Adaptive SoCs, and Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform (ACAP) products.\nWith the acquisition of Xilinx, we have access to a new set of markets and customers, further strengthening and diversifying our business model. In May 2022,\nwe expanded our data center solutions capabilities with the acquisition of Pensando Systems, Inc. (Pensando). We now offer high-performance data\nprocessing units (DPUs) and a software stack that complements our existing products. With the Xilinx and Pensando acquisitions, we are well positioned to\nprovide the industrys broadest set of leadership compute engines and accelerators to help enable best performance, security, flexibility and total cost of\nownership for leading-edge data centers.\nOur 2022 financial results reflect the strength of our diversified business model despite the challenging PC market conditions in the second half of 2022. Net\nrevenue for 2022 was $23.6 billion, an increase of 44% compared to 2021 net revenue of $16.4 billion. The increase in net revenue was driven by a 64%\nincrease in Data Center segment revenue primarily due to higher sales of our EPYC server processors, a 21% increase in Gaming segment revenue\nprimarily due to higher semi-custom product sales, and a significant increase in Embedded segment revenue from the prior year period driven by the inclusion\nof Xilinx embedded product sales. This growth was partially offset by a 10% decrease in Client segment revenue primarily due to lower processor shipments\ndriven by a weak PC market and significant inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2022,\nwas 45%, compared to 48% in 2021. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition.\nOperating income for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to operating income of $3.6 billion for 2021. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by\namortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition. Net income for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to $3.2 billion in the prior year. The\ndecrease in net income was primarily driven by lower operating income.\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2022 were $5.9 billion, compared to $3.6 billion at the end of 2021. Our aggregate\nprincipal amount of total debt as of December 31, 2022 was $2.5 billion, compared to $313 million as of December 25, 2021.\nWe took several actions in 2022 to strengthen our financial position. In June 2022, we issued $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes,\nconsisting of $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.924% Senior Notes due 2032 (3.924% Notes) and $500 million in aggregate principal amount of\n4.393% Senior Notes due 2052 (4.393% Notes). The 3.924% Notes will mature on June 1, 2032 and bear interest at a rate of 3.924% per annum, and the\n4.393% Notes will mature on June 1, 2052 and bear interest at a rate of 4.393% per annum. The 3.924% Notes and the 4.393% Notes are senior unsecured\nobligations.\n40\n [END OF FILING]",

We record these translation adjustments in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, a separate component of Equity, \nin our consolidated balance sheets. We record exchange gains and losses resulting from the conversion of transaction currency to functional \ncurrency as a component of Other income (expense), net. \nEmployee Benefit Plans \nPension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefits earned during the year, as well as interest on projected benefit obligations, \nare accrued. Prior service costs and credits resulting from changes in plan benefits are generally amortized over the average remaining service \nperiod of the employees expected to receive benefits. Expected return on plan assets is determined by applying the return on assets \nassumption to the actual fair value of plan assets. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized in Other income (expense), net in the year in \nwhich they occur. These gains and losses are measured annually as of December 31 or upon a remeasurement event. Verizon management \nemployees no longer earn pension benefits or earn service towards the Company retiree medical subsidy. See Note 11 for additional \ninformation. \nWe recognize a pension or a postretirement plans funded status as either an asset or liability in the consolidated balance sheets. Also, we \nmeasure any unrecognized prior service costs and credits that arise during the period as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive \nincome, net of applicable income tax. \nDerivative Instruments \nWe enter into derivative transactions primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. \nWe employ risk management strategies, which may include the use of a variety of derivatives including cross currency swaps, forward \nstarting interest rate swaps, interest rate swaps, treasury rate locks, interest rate caps and foreign exchange forwards. We do not hold \nderivatives for trading purposes. \nWe measure all derivatives at fair value and recognize them as either assets or liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Our derivative \ninstruments are valued primarily using models based on readily observable market parameters for all substantial terms of our derivative \ncontracts and thus are classified as Level 2. Changes in the fair values of derivative instruments applied as economic hedges are recognized in \nearnings in the current period. For fair value hedges, the change in the fair value of the derivative instruments is recognized in earnings, along \nwith the change in the fair value of the hedged item. For cash flow hedges, the change in the fair value of the derivative instruments is \nreported in Other comprehensive income (loss) and recognized in earnings when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. For net \ninvestment hedges of certain of our foreign operations, the change in the fair value of the hedging instruments is reported in Other \ncomprehensive income (loss) as part of the cumulative translation adjustment and partially offsets the impact of foreign currency changes on \nthe value of our net investment. \nCash flows from derivatives, which are designated as accounting hedges or applied as economic hedges, are presented consistently with the \ncash flow classification of the related hedged items. See Note 9 for additional information. \nVariable Interest Entities \nVIEs are entities that lack sufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from \nother parties, have equity investors that do not have the ability to make significant decisions relating to the entitys operations through voting \nrights, do not have the obligation to absorb the expected losses, or do not have the right to receive the residual returns of the entity. We \nconsolidate the assets and liabilities of VIEs when we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is the party that has \nthe power to make the decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and has the obligation to absorb losses or \nthe right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\n63\nVerizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\n\nfair value is measured using the NAV per share as a practical expedient are not leveled within the fair value hierarchy but are included in total \ninvestments. \nEmployer Contributions \nIn 2021, we made no discretionary contribution to our qualified pension plans, $58 million of contributions to our nonqualified pension plans \nand $885 million of contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS\nGENERAL\nThe following MD&A is intended to assist the reader in understanding our financial condition and results of operations, including an evaluation of the amounts\nand certainty of cash flows from operations and from outside sources, and is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with the condensed\nconsolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 1. Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.\nReferences to operational variances pertain to period-over-period changes that exclude the impact of foreign exchange rates. Although foreign exchange rate\nchanges are part of our business, they are not within our control and because they can mask positive or negative trends in the business, we believe presenting\noperational variances excluding these foreign exchange changes provides useful information to evaluate our results.\nOVERVIEW OF OUR PERFORMANCE, OPERATING ENVIRONMENT, STRATEGY AND OUTLOOK\nOur Business and StrategyPfizer Inc. is a research-based, global biopharmaceutical company. We apply science and our global resources to bring therapies\nto people that extend and significantly improve their lives. In 2023, we are making additional investments in both R&D and SI&A to support Pfizers near- and\nlonger-term growth plans, including to support anticipated new launches, commercial launch of COVID-19 products, potential pipeline programs and recently\nacquired assets. We manage our commercial operations through a global structure consisting of two operating segments: Biopharma and Business Innovation.\nBiopharma is the only reportable segment. See Note 13A.\nWe expect to incur costs of approximately $700 million in connection with separating Upjohn, of which approximately 90% has been incurred since inception\nand through the second quarter of 2023. These charges include costs and expenses related to separation of legal entities and transaction costs.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, we began taking steps through our Transforming to a More Focused Company restructuring program to optimize our end-to-end\nR&D operations to reduce costs and cycle times as well as to further prioritize our internal R&D portfolio in areas where our capabilities are differentiated\nwhile increasing external innovation efforts to leverage an expanding and productive biotech sector. See Note 3. For a description of savings related to this\nprogram, see the Costs and ExpensesRestructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives\nsection within MD&A.\nIn July 2023, we announced that in consideration of planned future investments in oncology, including the proposed acquisition of Seagen, we are reorganizing\nhow our R&D operations are conducted. Beginning in July 2023, discovery to early- and late-phase clinical development for oncology will be performed by a\nnew end-to-end Oncology Research and Development platform function and discovery to early- and late-phase clinical development for all remaining\ntherapeutic areas will be consolidated in the Pfizer Research and Development platform function.\nFor additional information about our business, strategy and operating environment, see the Item 1. Business section and Overview of Our Performance,\nOperating Environment, Strategy and Outlook section within MD&A of our 2022 Form 10-K.\nOur Business Development InitiativesWe are committed to strategically capitalizing on growth opportunities, primarily by advancing our own product\npipeline and maximizing the value of our existing products, but also through various business development activities. Our significant recent business\ndevelopment activities include the transactions discussed in Notes 1A and 2, including the proposed acquisition of Seagen, as well as the following:\nProposed Divestiture of Early-Stage Rare Disease Gene Therapy PortfolioIn July 2023, we entered into an agreement with Alexion, a subsidiary of\nAstraZeneca plc, under which Alexion will purchase and license the assets of our early-stage rare disease gene therapy portfolio. This agreement is consistent\nwith our previously announced strategy to pivot from viral capsid-based gene therapy approaches to harnessing new platform technologies that we believe can\nhave a transformative impact on patients, such as mRNA or in vivo gene editing. Under the terms of the agreement, Alexion will pay us total consideration of\nup to $1 billion, plus tiered royalties based on annual net sales of the assets. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2023, subject to\ncustomary closing conditions.\nAgreement with Flagship Pioneering, Inc. (Flagship)In July 2023, we and Flagship announced that we have partnered to create a new pipeline of innovative\nmedicines. Under the terms of the novel agreement, we and Flagship will each invest $50 million upfront to explore opportunities to develop 10 single-asset\nprograms by leveraging Flagships ecosystem of more than 40 human health companies and multiple biotechnology platforms. Pfizer will fund and have an\noption to acquire each selected development program. Flagship and its bioplatform companies will be eligible to receive up to $700 million in milestones and\nroyalties for each successfully commercialized program.\n38\n [END OF FILING]",

There may be a difference between the timing of cash receipts from the customer and\nthe recognition of revenue, resulting in a contract or contract-related liability. The Company generally has three types of liabilities related to contracts with\ncustomers: (1) outstanding chip liability, which represents the amounts owed in exchange for gaming chips held by a customer, (2) loyalty program obligations,\nwhich represents the deferred allocation of revenue relating to loyalty program incentives earned, and (3) customer advances and other, which is primarily\nfunds deposited by customers before gaming play occurs (casino front money) and advance payments on goods and services yet to be provided, such as\nadvance ticket sales and deposits on rooms and convention space or for unpaid wagers. These liabilities are generally expected to be recognized as revenue\nwithin one year of being purchased, earned, or deposited and are recorded within Other accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to contract and contract-related liabilities:\n \nOutstanding Chip Liability\nLoyalty Program\nCustomer Advances and Other\n \n2023\n \n2022\n2023\n \n2022\n2023\n \n2022\n \n(In thousands)\nBalance at January 1\n$\n185,669 \n$\n176,219 \n$\n183,602 \n$\n144,465 \n$\n816,376 \n$\n640,001 \nBalance at June 30\n196,446 \n165,564 \n194,570 \n160,752 \n806,072 \n704,404 \nIncrease / (decrease)\n$\n10,777 \n$\n(10,655)\n$\n10,968 \n$\n16,287 \n$\n(10,304)\n$\n64,403 \n9\n [END OF FILING]",

    "query": "Answer this question: As of Q2'2023, is Pfizer spinning off any large business segments? \nHere is the relevant evidence that you need to answer the question:\n[START OF FILING] ITEM 2. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS\nGENERAL\nThe following MD&A is intended to assist the reader in understanding our financial condition and results of operations, including an evaluation of the amounts\nand certainty of cash flows from operations and from outside sources, and is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with the condensed\nconsolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 1. Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.\nReferences to operational variances pertain to period-over-period changes that exclude the impact of foreign exchange rates. Although foreign exchange rate\nchanges are part of our business, they are not within our control and because they can mask positive or negative trends in the business, we believe presenting\noperational variances excluding these foreign exchange changes provides useful information to evaluate our results.\nOVERVIEW OF OUR PERFORMANCE, OPERATING ENVIRONMENT, STRATEGY AND OUTLOOK\nOur Business and StrategyPfizer Inc. is a research-based, global biopharmaceutical company. We apply science and our global resources to bring therapies\nto people that extend and significantly improve their lives. In 2023, we are making additional investments in both R&D and SI&A to support Pfizers near- and\nlonger-term growth plans, including to support anticipated new launches, commercial launch of COVID-19 products, potential pipeline programs and recently\nacquired assets. We manage our commercial operations through a global structure consisting of two operating segments: Biopharma and Business Innovation.\nBiopharma is the only reportable segment. See Note 13A.\nWe expect to incur costs of approximately $700 million in connection with separating Upjohn, of which approximately 90% has been incurred since inception\nand through the second quarter of 2023. These charges include costs and expenses related to separation of legal entities and transaction costs.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, we began taking steps through our Transforming to a More Focused Company restructuring program to optimize our end-to-end\nR&D operations to reduce costs and cycle times as well as to further prioritize our internal R&D portfolio in areas where our capabilities are differentiated\nwhile increasing external innovation efforts to leverage an expanding and productive biotech sector. See Note 3. For a description of savings related to this\nprogram, see the Costs and ExpensesRestructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives\nsection within MD&A.\nIn July 2023, we announced that in consideration of planned future investments in oncology, including the proposed acquisition of Seagen, we are reorganizing\nhow our R&D operations are conducted. Beginning in July 2023, discovery to early- and late-phase clinical development for oncology will be performed by a\nnew end-to-end Oncology Research and Development platform function and discovery to early- and late-phase clinical development for all remaining\ntherapeutic areas will be consolidated in the Pfizer Research and Development platform function.\nFor additional information about our business, strategy and operating environment, see the Item 1. Business section and Overview of Our Performance,\nOperating Environment, Strategy and Outlook section within MD&A of our 2022 Form 10-K.\nOur Business Development InitiativesWe are committed to strategically capitalizing on growth opportunities, primarily by advancing our own product\npipeline and maximizing the value of our existing products, but also through various business development activities. Our significant recent business\ndevelopment activities include the transactions discussed in Notes 1A and 2, including the proposed acquisition of Seagen, as well as the following:\nProposed Divestiture of Early-Stage Rare Disease Gene Therapy PortfolioIn July 2023, we entered into an agreement with Alexion, a subsidiary of\nAstraZeneca plc, under which Alexion will purchase and license the assets of our early-stage rare disease gene therapy portfolio. This agreement is consistent\nwith our previously announced strategy to pivot from viral capsid-based gene therapy approaches to harnessing new platform technologies that we believe can\nhave a transformative impact on patients, such as mRNA or in vivo gene editing. Under the terms of the agreement, Alexion will pay us total consideration of\nup to $1 billion, plus tiered royalties based on annual net sales of the assets. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2023, subject to\ncustomary closing conditions.\nAgreement with Flagship Pioneering, Inc. (Flagship)In July 2023, we and Flagship announced that we have partnered to create a new pipeline of innovative\nmedicines. Under the terms of the novel agreement, we and Flagship will each invest $50 million upfront to explore opportunities to develop 10 single-asset\nprograms by leveraging Flagships ecosystem of more than 40 human health companies and multiple biotechnology platforms. Pfizer will fund and have an\noption to acquire each selected development program. Flagship and its bioplatform companies will be eligible to receive up to $700 million in milestones and\nroyalties for each successfully commercialized program.\n38\n [END OF FILING]",

These statements are not guarantees and are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in circumstances that are difficult to\npredict. Many factors, including those set forth in the Risk Factors section below and other important factors disclosed in this report and from\ntime to time in our other filings with the SEC, could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from these forward-looking statements.\nAny forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-\nlooking statement whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties and our actual results and future trends may differ\nmaterially from our past or projected future performance. We urge investors to consider carefully the risk factors described below in evaluating\nthe information contained in this report.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nWe depend heavily on commercial airlines, subjecting us to unique risks.\nMarket conditions have a significant impact on demand for our commercial aircraft and related services. The commercial aircraft market is\npredominantly driven by long-term trends in airline passenger and cargo traffic. The principal factors underlying long-term traffic growth are\nsustained economic growth and political stability both in developed and emerging markets. Demand for our commercial aircraft is further\ninfluenced by airline profitability, availability of aircraft financing, world trade policies, government-to-government relations, technological\nadvances, price and other competitive factors, fuel prices, terrorism, pandemics, epidemics and environmental regulations. Historically, the\nairline industry has been cyclical and very competitive and has experienced significant profit swings and constant challenges to be more cost\ncompetitive. Significant deterioration in the global economic environment, the airline industry generally or the financial stability of one or more of\nour major customers could result in fewer new orders for aircraft or services, or could cause customers to seek to postpone or cancel contractual\norders and/or payments to us, which could result in lower revenues, profitability and cash flows and a reduction in our contractual backlog. In\naddition, because our commercial aircraft backlog consists of aircraft scheduled for delivery over a period of several years, any of these\nmacroeconomic, industry or customer impacts could unexpectedly affect deliveries over a long period.\nWe enter into firm fixed-price aircraft sales contracts with indexed price escalation clauses, which could subject us to losses if we have cost\noverruns or if increases in our costs exceed the applicable escalation rate. Commercial aircraft sales contracts are often entered into years\nbefore the aircraft are delivered. In order to help account for economic fluctuations between the contract date and delivery date, aircraft pricing\ngenerally consists of a fixed amount as modified by price escalation formulas derived from labor, commodity and other price indices. Our\nrevenue estimates are based on current expectations with respect to these escalation formulas, but the actual escalation amounts are outside of\nour control. Escalation factors can fluctuate significantly from period to period. Changes in escalation amounts can significantly impact revenues\nand operating margins in our Commercial Airplanes business.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of commercial airlines. We can make no assurance that any customer will\nexercise purchase options, fulfill existing purchase commitments or purchase additional products or services from us. In addition, fleet decisions,\nairline consolidations or financial challenges involving any of our major commercial airline customers could significantly reduce our revenues and\nlimit our opportunity to generate profits from those customers.\n6\n [END OF FILING]",

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 and for\neach of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 and related notes, which are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as with the\nother sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nIntroduction\nIn this section, we will describe the general financial condition and the results of operations of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries\n(collectively, us, our or AMD), including a discussion of our results of operations for 2022 compared to 2021, an analysis of changes in our financial\ncondition and a discussion of our off-balance sheet arrangements. Discussions of 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020 that are\nnot included in this Form 10-K can be found in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of\nour Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2021.\nOverview\n2022 was a transformative year for AMD as we took several major steps that scaled and reshaped our business. In February 2022, we completed our strategic\nacquisition of Xilinx, Inc. (Xilinx) which expanded our technology and product portfolio to include adaptable hardware platforms that enable hardware\nacceleration and rapid innovation across a variety of technologies and established AMD in multiple embedded markets where we have traditionally not had a\nsignificant presence. We now offer Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Adaptive SoCs, and Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform (ACAP) products.\nWith the acquisition of Xilinx, we have access to a new set of markets and customers, further strengthening and diversifying our business model. In May 2022,\nwe expanded our data center solutions capabilities with the acquisition of Pensando Systems, Inc. (Pensando). We now offer high-performance data\nprocessing units (DPUs) and a software stack that complements our existing products. With the Xilinx and Pensando acquisitions, we are well positioned to\nprovide the industrys broadest set of leadership compute engines and accelerators to help enable best performance, security, flexibility and total cost of\nownership for leading-edge data centers.\nOur 2022 financial results reflect the strength of our diversified business model despite the challenging PC market conditions in the second half of 2022. Net\nrevenue for 2022 was $23.6 billion, an increase of 44% compared to 2021 net revenue of $16.4 billion. The increase in net revenue was driven by a 64%\nincrease in Data Center segment revenue primarily due to higher sales of our EPYC server processors, a 21% increase in Gaming segment revenue\nprimarily due to higher semi-custom product sales, and a significant increase in Embedded segment revenue from the prior year period driven by the inclusion\nof Xilinx embedded product sales. This growth was partially offset by a 10% decrease in Client segment revenue primarily due to lower processor shipments\ndriven by a weak PC market and significant inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2022,\nwas 45%, compared to 48% in 2021. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition.\nOperating income for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to operating income of $3.6 billion for 2021. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by\namortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition. Net income for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to $3.2 billion in the prior year. The\ndecrease in net income was primarily driven by lower operating income.\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2022 were $5.9 billion, compared to $3.6 billion at the end of 2021. Our aggregate\nprincipal amount of total debt as of December 31, 2022 was $2.5 billion, compared to $313 million as of December 25, 2021.\nWe took several actions in 2022 to strengthen our financial position. In June 2022, we issued $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes,\nconsisting of $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.924% Senior Notes due 2032 (3.924% Notes) and $500 million in aggregate principal amount of\n4.393% Senior Notes due 2052 (4.393% Notes). The 3.924% Notes will mature on June 1, 2032 and bear interest at a rate of 3.924% per annum, and the\n4.393% Notes will mature on June 1, 2052 and bear interest at a rate of 4.393% per annum. The 3.924% Notes and the 4.393% Notes are senior unsecured\nobligations.\n40\n [END OF FILING]",

    "query": "Answer this question: Was American Express able to retain card members during 2022? \nHere is the relevant evidence that you need to answer the question:\n[START OF FILING] Table of Contents\nBUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\nOur results for the year demonstrate that our growth strategy is working and our business is in an even stronger position today than before the pandemic.\nSpending on our network reached record levels, and credit metrics remain below pre-pandemic levels. Our investments in product innovation, technology,\npeople and our brand has led to increased generational relevance with Millennial and Gen Z customers, record new card acquisitions, deeper relationships with\ncustomers and expanded merchant acceptance.\nFor 2022, we reported net income of $7.5 billion, or $9.85 per share, compared with net income of $8.1 billion, or $10.02 per share, a year ago. The reduction\nin net income reflected credit reserve builds and net losses in our Amex Ventures strategic investment portfolio in the current year compared with sizeable\ncredit reserve releases and significant net gains in our Amex Ventures strategic investment portfolio in the prior year.\nWorldwide network volumes for the year increased 21 percent compared to the prior year (24 percent on an FX-adjusted basis ). Billed business, which\nrepresented 86 percent of our total network volumes and is the most significant driver of our financial results, increased 23 percent year-over-year (25 percent\non an FX-adjusted basis ), demonstrating our continued ability to acquire, engage and retain high-spending, premium Card Members. U.S. Consumer billed\nbusiness grew by 24 percent year-over-year, reflecting continued strength in spending trends from our premium U.S. consumer Card Members. Billed business\nin our Commercial Services segment grew by 21 percent on a year-over-year basis, reflecting continued growth from U.S. small and mid-sized enterprise\ncustomers, as well as continued steady recovery in spending by our U.S. large and global corporate clients. International billed business grew by 23 percent\nyear-over-year (36 percent on an FX-adjusted basis ), driven by a strong recovery in spend across both consumer and commercial customers. T&E spending\nmomentum remained strong throughout the year, while year-over-year Goods & Services spending growth slowed towards the end of the year following the\nlarge pandemic recovery growth rates experienced earlier in the year. Inflation was a modest contributor to our strong billed business growth, while the\ncontinuing strengthening of the U.S. dollar, relative to the prior year, against most major currencies in which we operate, had a negative impact on our\ninternational billings.\nTotal revenues net of interest expense increased 25 percent year-over-year (27 percent on an FX-adjusted basis ), reflecting strong growth in all our revenue\nlines. Discount revenue, our largest revenue line, increased 25 percent year-over-year, driven primarily by the momentum in our Card Member spending\nvolumes throughout 2022. Net card fees increased 17 percent year over-year, as new card acquisitions reached record levels in 2022 and Card Member\nretention remained high, demonstrating the impact of investments we have made in our premium value propositions. Service fees and other revenues increased\n36 percent year-over-year, driven in part by higher travel-related revenues. Net interest income increased 28 percent versus the prior year, primarily driven by\ngrowth in Card Member loans. While the rising interest rate environment had a fairly neutral impact on our results for the full year, rising rates did have a\nmodest negative impact on net interest income towards the end of the year.\nCard Member loans increased 22 percent year-over-year, with the majority of growth coming from existing Card Members and was driven by ongoing strong\ngrowth in billed business, which began to moderate towards the end of the year as we lapped the steep phase of recovery. Provisions for credit losses increased\nversus the prior year, reflecting a reserve build of $617 million compared with a reserve release of $2.5 billion in the prior year, and are expected to increase in\n2023. While delinquency and net write-off rates continued to increase throughout the year, these metrics remain strong, supported by the premium nature of our\ncustomer base, our risk management capabilities and risk actions we took throughout the year.\nThe foreign currency adjusted information assumes a constant exchange rate between the periods being compared for purposes of currency translation into U.S. dollars (i.e., assumes the foreign\nexchange rates used to determine results for the current period apply to the corresponding prior year period against which such results are being compared). FX-adjusted revenues is a non GAAP\nmeasure. We believe the presentation of information on a foreign currency adjusted basis is helpful to investors by making it easier to compare our performance in one period to that of another period\nwithout the variability caused by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1 \n42\n [END OF FILING]",

Certain customers pay us non-recurring\nengineering fees for design and development services and a purchase price for the resulting products.\nOne customer accounted for 16% of our consolidated net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. Sales to this customer consisted of sales of products\nfrom our Gaming segment. A loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOriginal Equipment Manufacturers\nWe focus on three types of OEM partners: multi-nationals, selected regional accounts and selected global and local system integrators, who target commercial\nand consumer end customers of all sizes. Large multi-nationals and regional accounts are the core of our OEM partners business; however, we are\nincreasingly focused on the VAR channel which resells OEM systems to the mid-market and the small and medium business (SMB) segments. Additionally, we\nhave increased our focus on global system integrators, which resell OEM systems, coupled with their software and services solutions into Enterprise, high\nperformance computing (HPC) and Cloud Service Provider Customers. Our OEM customers include numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers of servers\nand workstations, desktops, notebooks, PC motherboards and game consoles.\nThird-Party Distributors\nOur authorized channel distributors resell to sub-distributors and OEMs, ODMs, and other customers. Typically, distributors handle a wide variety of products,\nand may include products from other manufacturers that compete with our products. Distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products. In most\ninstances, our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions and provide certain return rights with respect to any\nproduct that we have removed from our price book or otherwise subject to discontinuation. In addition, some agreements with our distributors may contain\nstandard stock rotation provisions permitting limited product returns.\nAdd-in-Board (AIB) Manufacturers and System Integrators\nWe offer component-level graphics and chipset products to AIB manufacturers who in turn build and sell board-level products using our technology to system\nintegrators (SIs), retail buyers and sub distributors. Our agreements with AIBs protect their inventory of our products against price reductions. We also sell\ndirectly to our SI customers. SIs typically sell from positions of regional or product-based strength in the market. They usually operate on short design cycles\nand can respond quickly with new technologies. SIs often use discrete graphics solutions as a means to differentiate their products and add value to their\ncustomers.\nCompetition in Data Center Segment\nIn Data Center, we compete against Intel Corporation (Intel) with our FPGA, Adaptive SoC, CPU and DPU server products and NVIDIA Corporation (NVIDIA)\nwith our CPU, GPU and DPU server products. A variety of companies provide or have developed ARM-based microprocessors and platforms. ARM-based\ndesigns are being used in the server market, which could lead to further growth and development of the ARM ecosystem.\nCompetition in Client Segment\nThe markets in which we participate are highly competitive. Our primary competitor in the supply of CPUs is Intel. A variety of companies provide or have\ndeveloped ARM-based microprocessors and platforms. ARM-based designs are being used in the PC market, which could lead to further growth and\ndevelopment of the ARM ecosystem.\n9\n [END OF FILING]",

    "query": "Answer this question: Which Best Buy product category performed the best (by top line) in the domestic (USA) Market during Q2 of FY2024? \nHere is the relevant evidence that you need to answer the question:\n[START OF FILING]  \nTable of Contents\n \nNotable comparable sales changes by revenue category were as follows:\n \n\nComputing and Mobile Phones: The 6.4% comparable sales decline was driven primarily by computing, mobile phones and tablets.\n\nConsumer Electronics: The 5.7% comparable sales decline was driven primarily by home theater, partially offset by comparable sales growth in \nheadphones and portable speakers. \n\nAppliances: The 16.1% comparable sales decline was driven primarily by large appliances.\n\nEntertainment: The 9.0% comparable sales growth was driven primarily by gaming, partially offset by comparable sales declines in virtual reality and \ndrones.\n\nServices: The 7.6% comparable sales growth was driven primarily by the cumulative growth in our paid membership base.\n \nOur gross profit rate increased in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily due to favorable product margin rates, improved financial performance from our \nmembership offerings, which included higher services margin rates and reduced costs associated with program changes made to our free membership offering, \nand an improved gross profit rate from our Health initiatives.\n \nOur gross profit rate increased in the first six months of fiscal 2024, primarily due to improved financial performance from our membership offerings, which \nincluded higher services margin rates and reduced costs associated with program changes made to our free membership offering, favorable product margin \nrates, the profit-sharing revenue from our private label and co-branded credit card arrangement and an improved gross profit rate from our Health initiatives.\n \nOur profit-sharing revenue from our credit card arrangement has been a consistent benefit to our gross profit and operating income rates for the past nine \nquarters and approximated 1.4% of Domestic revenue in fiscal 2023, an increase of approximately 50 basis points compared to fiscal 2020. This growth has \nbeen driven by the increased usage of our credit card, both at and outside of Best Buy, and the favorable credit environment. For fiscal 2024, we expect this \nprofit-sharing revenue to have a relatively neutral impact to our annual gross profit rate compared to last year, as the benefit from the first half of the year is \nexpected to turn to a slight pressure in the second half of the year.\n \nOur SG&A in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 was approximately flat to last year, as higher incentive compensation was primarily offset by lower store payroll \nexpense.\n \nOur SG&A in the first six months of fiscal 2024 decreased primarily due to lower store payroll expense, partially offset by higher incentive compensation expense. \n \nThe reduction in restructuring charges in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2024 was primarily related to higher-than-expected employee retention \nfrom our fiscal 2023 resource optimization initiative. Refer to Note 2, Restructuring, of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, included in \nthis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.\n \nOur operating income rate increased in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, due to an increase in gross profit rate and lower restructuring charges, partially offset \nby an unfavorable SG&A rate. \n \nOur operating income rate decreased in the six months of fiscal 2024, primarily due to decreased leverage from lower sales volume on our fixed expenses and \nhigher incentive compensation expense, which resulted in an unfavorable SG&A rate, partially offset by favorability in gross profit rate.\n \nInternational Segment\n \nSelected financial data for the International segment was as follows ($ in millions):\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThree Months Ended\n \nSix Months Ended\n \nJuly 29, 2023\n \nJuly 30, 2022\n \nJuly 29, 2023\n \nJuly 30, 2022\nRevenue\n$\n 693 \n $\n 760 \n $\n 1,359 \n $\n 1,513 \nRevenue % change\n \n (8.8)% \n (9.3)% \n (10.2)% \n (7.4)%\nComparable sales % change\n \n (5.4)% \n (4.2)% \n (5.5)% \n (2.8)%\nGross profit\n$\n 168 \n $\n 178 \n $\n 326 \n $\n 361 \nGross profit as a % of revenue\n \n 24.2 % \n 23.4 % \n 24.0 % \n 23.9 %\nSG&A\n$\n 149 \n $\n 150 \n $\n 287 \n $\n 299 \nSG&A as a % of revenue\n \n 21.5 % \n 19.7 % \n 21.1 % \n 19.8 %\nRestructuring charges\n$\n - \n $\n - \n $\n (1) \n $\n 1 \nOperating income\n$\n 19 \n $\n 28 \n $\n 40 \n $\n 61 \nOperating income as a % of revenue\n \n 2.7 % \n 3.7 % \n 2.9 % \n 4.0 %\n \nThe decreases in revenue in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2024 were primarily driven by comparable sales declines of 5.4% and 5.5%, \nrespectively, and the negative impact from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. \n \n18\n [END OF FILING]",
