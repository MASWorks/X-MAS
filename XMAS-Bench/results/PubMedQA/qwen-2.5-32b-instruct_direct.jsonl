Specifically, we sought to evaluate for effect modification between DM, a newly discovered prostate cancer susceptibility locus on chromosome 17q12 (single nucleotide polymorphism rs4430796) and prostate cancer features. In 593 genotyped men treated with radical prostatectomy (RP), we examined RP features stratified by DM and rs4430796 carrier status. Despite a significantly higher body mass index among patients with DM, individual pathological features were similar between men with and without DM. Using a dominant model, 17q12 carriers were less likely to have DM and more likely to have a RP Gleason score of>or=7.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Stigmatizing attitudes toward people with disabilities can jeopardize such individuals' well-being and recovery through denial of employment and community isolation. By shaping social norms that define group membership, the construct of individualism may partially explain differences in stigmatizing attitudes across cultures. Further, widespread globalization has brought intensely individualistic social practices to certain segments of non-Western cultures. This paper examines whether the construct of individualism can help to explain cross-cultural differences in stigmatizing attitudes observed between American and Chinese employers. Employers (N = 879) from Beijing, Hong Kong, and Chicago provided information on their attitudes toward hiring people with disabilities, and path analyses were conducted to examine potential mediating relationships. Path analyses indicated that vertical individualism, along with perceived responsibility for acquiring a condition, partially mediated the relationship between culture and employers' negative attitudes about job candidates with disabilities.\nQuestion: Does individualism help explain differences in employers' stigmatizing attitudes toward disability across Chinese and American cities?", "gt": "These results suggested that greater espousal of competitive and individualist values may drive stigmatizing attitudes across cultures.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Yes, individualism, particularly vertical individualism, helps explain differences in employers' stigmatizing attitudes toward disability across Chinese and American cities. The research indicates that vertical individualism, combined with the perception of personal responsibility for acquiring a disability, partially mediates the relationship between cultural background and negative hiring attitudes towards individuals with disabilities.

But in the world of robotic and computerized surgery, this is increasingly a myopic approach, because the principle means of protecting high-tech surgical instruments is through the application of patent law. The issue is: does the Brookhill-Wilk patent, which covers the performance of remote robotic surgery, impede the growth of cybersurgery? Review of the Brookhill-Wilk patent and relevant law. Patent law, which first took its form in the Middle Ages, attempts to balance the rewarding of innovation with the stifling of market growth. Using US patent law as a model, it would appear that the Brookhill-Wilk patent, a particular example of a medical process patent, could inhibit the growth of cybersurgery, as potential sums of money could be demanded by the patent holder from anyone who practises cybersurgery. However, two recent US Supreme Court cases appear to have seriously undermined the validity of a number of medical process patents, including the Brookhill-Wilk patent.\nQuestion: Are the Brookhill-Wilk patents impediments to market growth in cybersurgery?", "gt": "Based on recent changes in patent law, it is not expected that Brookhill-Wilk patent will hinder the growth of cybersurgery.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the context provided, the Brookhill-Wilk patents, which cover the performance of remote robotic surgery, were initially considered potential impediments to market growth in cybersurgery due to the possibility of patent holders demanding significant licensing fees from practitioners.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Seeds of annual halophytes such as Suaeda maritima experience fluctuating salinity, hydration, hypoxia and temperature during dormancy. Germination then occurs in one flush of 2-3 weeks after about 5 months of winter dormancy during which time the seeds can remain in saline, often waterlogged soil. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of simulated natural conditions during dormancy on germination and to compare this with germination following the usual conditions of storing seeds dry. The effects of hydration, salinity, hypoxia and temperature regimes imposed during dormancy on germination were investigated. Also looked at were the effects of seed size on germination and the interaction between salinity during dormancy and salinity at the time of germination. Various pre-treatments were imposed on samples of seeds that had been stored dry or wet for different periods of time during the 5 months of natural dormancy. Subsequent germination tests were carried out in conditions that simulated those found in the spring when germination occurs naturally. Various salinities were imposed at germination for a test of interaction between storage salinity and salinity at germination. A temperature of about 15 degrees C was needed for germination and large seeds germinated earlier and better than small seeds. Cold seawater pre-treatment was necessary for good germination; the longer the saline pre-treatment during the natural dormancy period the better the germination. There appeared to be no effect of any specific ion of the seawater pre-treatment on germination and severe hypoxia did not prevent good germination. A short period of freezing stimulated early germination in dry-stored seed. Storage in cold saline or equivalent osmotic medium appeared to inhibit germination during the natural dormancy period and predispose the seed to germinate when the temperature rose and the salinity fell. Seeds that were stored in cold wet conditions germinated better in saline conditions than those stored dry.\nQuestion: Do conditions during dormancy influence germination of Suaeda maritima?", "gt": "The conditions under which seeds of S. maritima are stored affect their subsequent germination. Under natural conditions seeds remain dormant in highly saline, anoxic mud and then germinate when the temperature rises above about 15 degrees C and the salinity is reduced.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Yes, conditions during dormancy do influence the germination of Suaeda maritima.

The RUPG provided additional information in 11 patients (18.9% of those who had RUPG), leading to a modification of the surgical approach in these cases. This suggests that RUPG can offer valuable information that may influence surgical planning, but the necessity of performing it is not directly tied to the type of surgical approach chosen for pyeloplasty."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Earlier studies have given conflicting results regarding the effect of exposure to tobacco smoke on atopic sensibilization. A cross-sectional study of present and former smoking habits in relation to atopic disorders from data on 6909 young and middle-aged adults (16-49 years) and their 4472 children (3-15 years) from the Swedish Survey of Living Conditions in 1996-97. The prevalence of allergic asthma and allergic rhino-conjunctivitis decreased, in a dose-response manner (P = 0.03 and P = 0.004, respectively), with increasing exposure to tobacco smoke in the adult study population. This pattern was little changed when potential confounders (sex, age, education, domicile, country of birth) were entered into a multivariate analysis: the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for allergic rhino-conjunctivitis was 0.5 (0.4-0.7) for those who smoked at least 20 cigarettes a day and OR 0.7 (0.6-0.9) for those smoking 10-19 cigarettes, compared with those who reported that they never had smoked Former smokers had a tendency for a slightly lower risk: OR 0.9 (0.8-1.0). In a multivariate analysis, children of mothers who smoked at least 15 cigarettes a day tended to have lower odds for suffering from allergic rhino-conjunctivitis, allergic asthma, atopic eczema and food allergy, compared to children of mothers who had never smoked (ORs 0.6-0.7).

This pattern was observed both in the adult study population and in children of parents who smoked. However, it's important to note that this association does not necessarily imply causation. Additionally, while the study suggests a lower risk of atopic disorders with tobacco smoke exposure, it is crucial to consider the numerous harmful effects of tobacco smoke on health. Therefore, the observed effect should not be interpreted as a justification for tobacco use or exposure as a preventive measure against atopic disorders."}

Four waves public-use Add Health data were used in the analysis (N=3342). Respondents were surveyed in 1995, 1996, 2001-2002, and 2008-2009. Current regular smoking, past-year alcohol use, past-year marijuana use, and ever use of other illegal drugs as well as past-year suicidal ideation were measured at the four waves (1995, 1996, 2001-2002, and 2008-2009). Fixed effects models with lagged dependent variables were modeled to test unidirectional associations between substance use and suicidal ideation, and nonrecursive models with feedback loops combining correlated fixed factors were conducted to examine reciprocal relations between each substance use and suicidal ideation, respectively. After adjusting for the latent time-invariant effects and lagged effects of dependent variables, the unidirectional associations from substance use to suicidal ideation were consistently significant, and vice versa. Nonrecursive model results showed that use of cigarette or alcohol increased risk of suicidal ideation, while suicidal ideation was not associated with cigarette or alcohol use. Reversely, drug use (marijuana and other drugs) did not increase risk of suicidal ideation, but suicidal ideation increased risk of illicit drug use.\nQuestion: Suicidal ideation and substance use among adolescents and young adults: a bidirectional relation?", "gt": "The results suggest that relations between substance use and suicidal ideation are unidirectional, with cigarette or alcohol use increasing risk of suicidal ideation and suicidal ideation increasing risk of illicit drug use.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the context provided, there is a bidirectional relationship between suicidal ideation and certain types of substance use among adolescents and young adults, but this relationship varies depending on the type of substance involved.\n\n- For cigarette and alcohol use, the relationship is unidirectional: substance use (cigarette smoking and alcohol use) increases the risk of suicidal ideation, but suicidal ideation does not increase the risk of these substance uses.\n\n- For illicit drug use (marijuana and other illegal drugs), the relationship is reversed: suicidal ideation increases the risk of illicit drug use, but illicit drug use does not increase the risk of suicidal ideation.\n\nTherefore, while there is a bidirectional relationship overall, it is not consistent across all types of substance use.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been suspected of cardiac teratogenicity, but reports have been inconsistent. Our aim was to investigate the rate of nonsyndromic congenital heart defects in newborns exposed in utero to SSRIs compared with unexposed controls. This prospective study of women who gave birth at our tertiary center from 2000 to 2007 yielded 235 women who reported first-trimester SSRI use during pregnancy. All newborns born during the study period and found to have a persistent cardiac murmur on day 2 or 3 of life were referred for examination by a pediatric cardiologist and by echocardiography. The findings were compared between the newborns who were exposed to SSRIs and those who were not. Nonsyndromic congenital heart defects were identified by echocardiography in 8 of 235 (3.40%) newborns exposed in utero to SSRIs and in 1083 of 67,636 (1.60%) non-exposed newborns. The difference in prevalence between the two groups was significant (relative risk, 2.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-4.39). The prevalence rates for paroxetine and fluoxetine exposure were 4.3% and 3.0%, respectively.

The environmental factor is the exposure to hydantoin (a type of anticonvulsant medication) during fetal development, which led to the fetal hydantoin syndrome-like phenotype in the children. This combination of genetic predisposition and environmental exposure during critical periods of development suggests that NFNS is a condition that results from both genetic and environmental interactions, rather than solely from epigenetic modifications."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Our objective was to clarify the clinical outcome of renal transplantation based on residual daily urine output (RDUO). We retrospectively analyzed a prospective database of 276 patients who underwent renal transplantation (Tx) between January 2008 and December 2012. Patients had pre-transplantation daily urine output measurement of 24-h proteinuria and were clinically re-evaluated the day before transplantation. We included patients with no daily urine output and those with residual daily urine output. Real bladder capacity was not measured. We excluded patients with a history of lower urinary tract malformation, those treated by trans-ileal conduit or enterocystoplasty, and those with early graft thrombosis or graft primary non-function. Sex ratio, age at Tx, pre-Tx MHC antibodies levels, donor age, and cold ischemia duration were not significantly different between the 2 groups. Dialysis duration was longer in group I (p<0.001). The dialysis duration was correlated with the volume of residual urine output (r=0.12, p<0.0001). We found 14 (19.4%) urological complications in Group I (11 urinary leaks and 3 urethral stenosis) and 13 (6.4%) in Group II (5 urinary leaks and 8 stenosis). This difference was significant (p=0.0013 and relative risk [RR]=2.2). Absence of residual daily urine output was a risk factor of post-transplantation urinary leak (p<0.0001: RR=2.95).

Additionally, the absence of RDUO was identified as a risk factor for post-transplantation urinary leaks. Furthermore, at the 3-year mark, graft survival rates were significantly lower in Group I (74.7%) compared to Group II (94.6%), indicating that residual daily urine output is associated with better clinical outcomes, including reduced complications and improved graft survival rates. Therefore, daily urine output does indeed matter in the context of renal transplantation, as it can influence the clinical outcomes and risk of complications."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: The purpose of this study was to determine, on the basis of the late fate of the intact aortic arch with abnormal tissue after aortic root replacement, whether the intact aortic arch should be replaced prophylactically at the time of aortic root replacement for annuloaortic ectasia in Marfan syndrome. A retrospective review was performed in 85 patients with Marfan syndrome who underwent aortic root replacement for annuloaortic ectasia with or without aortic dissection (mean age 37 years, range 19-61 years). These 85 patients were divided into four groups according to the postoperative condition of the residual aorta. In group I (n = 47), the patients underwent aortic root replacement for annuloaortic ectasia with or without localized dissection in the ascending aorta. In these patients the residual aorta, including the aortic arch, was therefore intact. In group II (n = 10), the aortic arch was intact, although the descending thoracic aorta was dissected because of the preoperative type B dissection. In groups III and IV, the patients had type A dissection involving the transverse arch associated with annuloaortic ectasia. In group III (n = 13), residual dissection existed in the descending thoracic aorta after concomitant total arch replacement. In group IV (n = 15), the aortic arch and the descending thoracic aorta were dissected. There were 5 early deaths (3 in group I, 1 in group II, and 1 in group III). Subsequent operations were required in 10, 5, 6, and 7 cases in groups I, II, III, and IV, respectively. Regarding the aortic arch, only 2 of 53 survivors of the initial hospitalization with an intact aortic arch (groups I and II) underwent subsequent total arch replacement for the onset of dissection in the aortic arch, and 4 of 14 survivors of the initial hospitalization with a residual dissecting arch (group III) needed subsequent total arch replacement. Actuarial freedom from arch repair among patients with an intact aortic arch (91% at 15 years) was significantly higher than that among patients with a residual dissecting arch (49% at 15 years, P =.0078).\nQuestion: Should the transverse aortic arch be replaced simultaneously with aortic root replacement for annuloaortic ectasia in Marfan syndrome?", "gt": "The incidence of new dissection in the residual intact arch after aortic root replacement was extremely low. Therefore prophylactic replacement of the intact arch does not appear to be necessary at aortic root replacement for annuloaortic ectasia in Marfan syndrome.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the information provided in the context, the study suggests that the transverse aortic arch does not necessarily need to be replaced prophylactically at the time of aortic root replacement for annuloaortic ectasia in Marfan syndrome if the aortic arch is intact. The study found that among patients with an intact aortic arch (groups I and II), the actuarial freedom from the need for arch repair was significantly higher (91% at 15 years) compared to those with a residual dissecting arch (49% at 15 years). This indicates that replacing the intact aortic arch prophylactically may not be warranted, as the risk of developing dissection in the intact aortic arch is relatively low.

Two days before admission, he completed a 14-day course of linezolid 600 mg PO BID for ampicillin-resistant enterococcal urinary tract infection. He was afebrile on admission and the dorsal aspect of his tongue was blackened centrally, browner peripherally, with normal pink mucosa on the periphery. Based on the Naranjo probability scale, the calculated score for tongue discoloration as a drug-related adverse event was 7 out of a maximum score of 13 points, designating it as a probable cause.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: To evaluate the potential of a simple and widely available technique as two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography to identify patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and low likelihood of functional recovery after coronary revascularization. Two-dimensional echocardiography and radionuclide ventriculography (RNV) were performed before coronary revascularization in 94 patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was measured by RNV. Regional wall motion abnormalities, wall motion score index, end-diastolic wall thickness (EDWT), left ventricular (LV) volumes and LV sphericity index were assessed in the echocardiographic images. RNV was repeated 9-12 months after revascularization to assess LVEF change; an improvement>or=5% was considered clinically significant. Nine hundred and ninety-nine segments were severely dysfunctional; 149 out of 999 (15%) had an EDWT<or=6 mm. A severe enlargement of the end-diastolic volume index (EDVI) (>or=100 ml/ml) and of the end-systolic volume index (>or=80 ml) was present in 32 (34%) and 21 (22%) patients, respectively. A spherical shape of the LV was observed in 35 (37%) patients. LVEF after revascularization increased in 30 out of 94 patients (32%) from 30+/-8% to 39+/-9% (P<0.0001). On multivariate analysis, the EDVI was the only predictor of no recovery in LVEF [odds ratio, 1.06, confidence interval (CI), 1.04-1.1, P<0.0001]. The cut-off value of EDVI>or=90 ml/ml accurately identified patients that virtually never recover. Post-operatively, LVEF increased in three out of 42 (7%, 95% CI 0-15%) patients with EDVI>or=90 ml/ml as compared to 27 out of 52 (52%) patients with EDVI<90 ml/ml (P<0.0001).\nQuestion: Does resting two-dimensional echocardiography identify patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and low likelihood of functional recovery after coronary revascularization?", "gt": "In patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and severe LV enlargement, improvement of LVEF after revascularization is unlikely to occur.

Patients with an EDVI of 90 ml/m\u00b2 or more had a very low rate of LVEF improvement (only 7% showed a clinically significant improvement), whereas patients with an EDVI below this threshold had a much higher likelihood of recovery (52% showed a clinically significant improvement).

This study is a subgroup analysis of a previously reported study. Entecavir, in either 0.5 or 1.0 mg/day doses, was given to 10 and nine patients for 52 weeks, respectively, and then all received 1.0 mg/day entecavir for an additional 68-92 weeks. There were no differences in biochemical and virological responses in the two groups of patients with respect to the two different initial doses of entecavir. Serum levels of alanine aminotransferase were normalized in 17 (90%) patients, and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) disappeared from the serum in two (14%) of the 14 patients who were HBeAg-positive before.

The 24 item CCKNOW questionnaire was mailed to patients known to have developed colorectal cancer as a complication of ulcerative colitis (cases) and to colitics from the Leicestershire inflammatory bowel disease patient database who had not developed cancer (controls). The mean (SD) CCKNOW scores for cases was 8.21 (3.02) and for controls was 8.27 (4.3). These scores did not differ significantly between cases and controls (difference 0.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.7 to 1.5, p=0.9).

We included patients who had histologic confirmation of primary RCC and radiographic evidence of metastatic bone lesions. The most common SBRT regimen used was 27 Gy in 3 fractions. Median follow-up was 10 months (range, 1-64 months). Median time to symptom control between SBRT and CF-EBRT were 2 (range, 0-6 weeks) and 4 weeks (range, 0-7 weeks), respectively.

We investigated 8 initial patterns of care that integrated type of provider (general practitioners, chiropractors, and specialists) and number of visits (low versus high utilization). Cox models were used to estimate the association between patterns of care and time to recovery while controlling for injury severity and other confounders. Patients in the low-utilization general practitioner group and those in the general medical group had the fastest recovery even after controlling for important prognostic factors. Compared with the low-utilization general practitioner group, the 1-year rate of recovery in the high-utilization chiropractic group was 25% slower (adjusted hazard rate ratio [HRR] 0.75, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]0.54-1.04), in the low-utilization general practitioner plus chiropractic group the rate was 26% slower (HRR 0.74, 95% CI 0.60-0.93), and in the high-utilization general practitioner plus chiropractic combined group the rate was 36% slower (HRR 0.64, 95% CI 0.50-0.83).\nQuestion: Early aggressive care and delayed recovery from whiplash: isolated finding or reproducible result?", "gt": "The observation that intensive health care utilization early after a whiplash injury is associated with slower recovery was reproduced in an independent cohort of patients.

Allografts after resuscitation episode were implanted in 13 patients (6 M, 7 F, age 31-65 years). 11 patients were on the urgency list and two of them required periodically intravenous inotropic therapy. Two patients (P.A, B.J) died in the first 24 hours after procedure (cause of death: pulmonary embolism, extensive cardiac ischemia). During follow up (6-48 months, avg. 25.1 +/- 15.9 months) none of the 11 patients died. All patients are NYHA functional class I or I/II. Total time of cardiopulmonary resuscitation did not influence the time of reperfusion (p>0.05). Analysis of cardiac index Cl (l/min/m2) at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 72 hours after heart transplantation showed correct values during following days.

The indications for preputial surgery were recurrent balanoposthitis, ballooning during micturition and severe phimotic stenosis. The results after surgery were assessed using a questionnaire about the child's/parent's satisfaction, and an outpatient follow-up examination for functional and cosmetic preputial appearance. Of 128 parents/children responding, 108 (84%) were satisfied with the function and 102 (80%) reported a good cosmetic outcome. Triple incision as preputioplasty would be recommended to other parents by 119 (93%) respondents.

We randomly assigned 405 low-risk term nulliparous patients to either an active management of labor (n = 200) or our usual care control protocol (n = 205). Patients who were undergoing active management of labor were diagnosed as being in labor on the basis of having painful palpable contractions accompanied by 80% cervical effacement, underwent early amniotomy, and were treated with high-dose oxytocin for failure to progress adequately in labor. The cesarean section rate in the active management of labor group was lower than that of controls but not significantly so (active management, 7.5%; controls, 11.7%; p = 0.36). The length of labor in the active management group was shortened by 1.7 hours (from 11.4 to 9.7 hours, p = 0.001). Fifty-five percent of patients received epidural analgesics; a reduction in length of labor persisted despite the use of epidural analgesics (active management 11.2 hours vs control 13.3 hours, p = 0.001).

However, the prognostic value of LAS in cardiomyopathies with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) has not been evaluated yet. In 146 subjects with non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (NIDCM, LVEF \u226445\u00a0%) LAS was assessed retrospectively from standard non-contrast SSFP cine sequences by measuring the distance between the epicardial border of the left ventricular apex and the midpoint of a line connecting the origins of the mitral valve leaflets in end-systole and end-diastole. The final values were calculated according to the strain formula. The primary endpoint of the study was defined as a combination of cardiac death, heart transplantation or aborted sudden cardiac death and occurred in 24 subjects during follow-up. Patients with LAS values>\u2009-5\u00a0% showed a significant higher rate of cardiac events independent of the presence of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE). The multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that LVEDV/BSA (HR: 1.01, p\u2009<\u20090.05), presence of LGE (HR: 2.51, p\u2009<\u20090.05) and LAS (HR: 1.28, p\u2009<\u20090.05) were independent predictors for cardiac events. In a sequential cox regression analysis LAS offered significant incremental information (p\u2009<\u20090.05) for the prediction of outcome in addition to LGE and LVEDV/BSA. Using a dichotomous three point scoring model for risk stratification, including LVEF<35\u00a0%, LAS>\u2009-10\u00a0% and the presence of LGE, patients with 3 points had a significantly higher risk for cardiac events than those with 2 or less points.\nQuestion: Left ventricular long axis strain: a new prognosticator in non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy?", "gt": "Assessment of long axis function with LAS offers significant incremental information for the prediction of cardiac events in NIDCM and improves risk stratification beyond established CMR parameters.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "The study suggests that left ventricular long axis strain (LAS) could indeed serve as a new prognosticator in non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (NIDCM).

Specifically, patients with LAS values greater than -5% had a significantly higher rate of adverse cardiac events, which included cardiac death, heart transplantation, or aborted sudden cardiac death. Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that LAS was an independent predictor of these events.

Currently, the treatment of rib fractures is symptomatic. Since it has been reported that pulsed ultrasounds accelerates repair of limb fractures, we hypothesized that the application of pulsed ultrasounds will modify the course of healing in an animal model of rib fracture. We studied 136 male Sprague-Dawley rats. Animals were randomly assigned to different groups of doses (none, 50, 100, and 250 mW/cm(2) of intensity for 3 minutes per day) and durations (2, 10, 20, and 28 days) of treatment with pulsed ultrasounds. In every subgroup, we analyzed radiologic and histologic changes in the bone callus. In addition, we examined changes in gene expression of relevant genes involved in wound repair in both control and treated animals. Histologic and radiologic consolidation was significantly increased by pulsed ultrasound treatment when applied for more than 10 days. The application of 50 mW/cm(2) was the most effective dose. Only the 100 and 250 mW/cm(2) doses were able to significantly increase messenger RNA expression of insulin-like growth factor 1, suppressor of cytokine signaling-2 and -3, and vascular endothelial growth factor and decrease monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and collagen type II-alpha 1.\nQuestion: Pulsed ultrasounds accelerate healing of rib fractures in an experimental animal model: an effective new thoracic therapy?", "gt": "Our findings indicate that pulsed ultrasound accelerates the consolidation of rib fractures.

Rats were allocated to four experimental groups. Group I rats were subjected to right portal vein ligation (RPVL); rats in groups II and III were administered doxorubicin prior to RPVL, with group III rats being additionally exposed to HBO sessions postoperatively; group IV rats was sham-operated. All rats were sacrificed on postoperative day 7, and liver injury was assessed by measuring alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels. Protein synthetic ability was determined based albumin levels and liver regeneration by the mitotic index (MI). The AST and ALT values of group II rats were significantly higher than those of group I, but not those of group III. Rats treated with doxorubicin and HBO (groups II and III) showed slightly but not significant differences in albumin levels than those subjected to only RPVL or sham-operated.

Although the recently developed multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) scan enhances the ability to diagnose choledocholithiasis, this technique is considered to have some limitations for evaluating the common bile duct (CBD).AIM: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the necessity for performing endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) as an add-on test to detect choledocholithiasis in patients who were diagnosed with gallstone disease without choledocholithiasis based on MDCT. Three hundred twenty patients with gallstone disease and no evidence of CBD stones according to MDCT underwent EUS between March 2006 and April 2011. If CBD stones were suspected based on the EUS results or clinical symptoms, a final diagnosis was obtained by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The patients' medical records were retrospectively analyzed based on clinical symptoms, biochemical findings, and results of the imaging studies. CBD stones were not detected with MDCT in 41 (12.8 %) out of 320 patients with gallstone disease. The causes for these discrepancies could be attributed to small stone size (n = 19, 46.3 %), isodensity (n = 18, 43.9 %), impacted stones (n = 1, 2.4 %), and misdiagnosis (n = 3, 7.3 %).

Seventeen clinical vignettes were drawn from clinical indications evaluated by the expert panel. A vignette case questionnaire asking for treatment options in 9 or 10 clinical situations was submitted to 26 practicing gastroenterologists. For each vignette case, practitioners\u2019 answers on treatments deemed appropriate were compared with panel decisions.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: To assess in vitro the cariogenic and erosive potentials of Brazilian liquid oral paediatric medicines. Twenty-three paediatric medicines available on the Brazilian market were evaluated. The sample consisted of antihistamines, antitussives, bronchodilators and mucolytics. Duplicates of each bottle were analyzed for sugar concentration using normal-phase- high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Quantification of sugars and sorbitol was calculated using the peak heights of commercial standards as references. pH measurements were determined using a digital pH meter. Titratable acidity was assessed by diluting three aliquots of each medicine, and increments of 0.1N NaOH were titrated until neutrality was reached. Viscosity was determined using a viscosemeter. Sugars were detected in 56.5% of the medicines. Sucrose was identified in 10 medicines, with concentrations ranging from 11.36 g% to 85.99 g%. Glucose was detected in five medicines, with concentrations varying from 4.64 g% to 40.19 g%; fructose in six medicines, with concentrations ranging from 5.09 g% to 46.71 g%. Twelve medicines exhibited sorbitol, with values ranging from 5.39 g% to 46.09 g%. Most tested medicines were acidic, with pH values ranging between 2.6 and 5.7. Only two medicines (Fluimucil and Polaramine) presented pH 6.4 and 6.0, respectively. Titratable acidity mean values ranged between 0.28 and 16.33 mL.

Low pH values and high titratable acidity (ranging between 0.28 and 16.33 mL) are risk factors for dental erosion, as they can directly cause the dissolution of tooth enamel. The viscosity of the medicines, which varied significantly, could also play a role in their retention in the oral cavity, potentially prolonging the exposure to sugars and acids.\n\nIn summary, the presence of sugars and the acidic nature of many of these paediatric medicines suggest they could contribute to the risk of dental caries and erosion. Parents and healthcare providers should be aware of these potential risks and consider these factors when administering such medications to children."}

In this study, participants living with children were selected (n = 371 women, 352 men). The importance of relative socioeconomic position and perception of gender inequality in the couple relationship in combination with domestic work for psychological distress was examined through logistic regression analysis. Two combinations of variables including socioeconomic position ('having less than half of the responsibility for domestic work and partner higher socioeconomic position' and 'having more than half the responsibility for domestic work and equal socioeconomic position') were related to psychological distress. There were also higher ORs for psychological distress for the combinations of having 'less than half of the responsibility for domestic work and gender-unequal couple relationship' and 'more than half the responsibility for domestic work and gender-unequal couple relationship'. Having a lower socioeconomic position than the partner was associated with higher ORs for psychological distress among men.\nQuestion: Domestic work and psychological distress--what is the importance of relative socioeconomic position and gender inequality in the couple relationship?", "gt": "This study showed that domestic work is a highly gendered activity as women tend to have a greater and men a smaller responsibility. Both these directions of inequality in domestic work, in combination with experiencing the couple relationship as gender-unequal, were associated with psychological distress There is a need for more research with a relational approach on inequalities in health in order to capture the power relations within couples in various settings.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "The study highlights that the relative socioeconomic position and the perception of gender inequality within a couple relationship play significant roles in the association between domestic work and psychological distress. Specifically, the analysis through logistic regression revealed that:\n\n1. **Relative Socioeconomic Position**: When a person has less than half of the responsibility for domestic work and their partner has a higher socioeconomic position, or when a person has more than half of the responsibility for domestic work and there is an equal socioeconomic position, these combinations are related to higher levels of psychological distress. This suggests that socioeconomic disparity within a relationship, especially when combined with domestic work responsibilities, can contribute to increased psychological distress.\n\n2. **Gender Inequality in the Couple Relationship**: The study found that higher odds ratios (ORs) for psychological distress are associated with combinations where a person feels they have a less than half or more than half responsibility for domestic work in a gender-unequal couple relationship. This indicates that perceptions of gender inequality can exacerbate the negative psychological impact of domestic work responsibilities.\n\nMoreover, the study noted that men who felt they had a lower socioeconomic position than their partners were also associated with higher ORs for psychological distress. This finding underscores the complex interplay between socioeconomic factors, gender roles, and domestic responsibilities in contributing to psychological well-being within relationships."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Fibromyalgia (FM) is a form of non-articular rheumatism characterised by chronic widespread musculoskeletal aching. Although some works have investigated the possible role of oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of FM, none has analysed a significant number of oxidative markers in the same patients. Consequently, we have performed an exhaustive study of the oxidative/antioxidative status in FM patients and healthy controls, as well as the relationship with FM clinical parameters. In 45 female patients and 25 age-matched controls, we investigated the oxidative (lipid and protein peroxidation, and oxidative DNA damage) and antioxidative status (total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and antioxidant enzyme activities and compounds). Functional capacity and musculoskeletal pain were assessed by Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), respectively. The physical (PCS-12) and mental (MCS-12) health status was evaluated by SF-12. A significant increase in oxidative DNA damage and protein carbonyl content was found in FM patients vs. controls, as well as in antioxidant compounds such as copper and ceruloplasmin. Patients had diminished levels of TAC and zinc. Enzyme activities of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase were lower in FM patients. Significant correlations were observed in patients between oxidative DNA damage and MCS-12, and zinc and PCS-12.\nQuestion: Is fibromyalgia-related oxidative stress implicated in the decline of physical and mental health status?", "gt": "These findings reveal an imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants in FM patients. The lower antioxidant enzyme activities may lead to oxidative stress through the oxidation of DNA and proteins, which may affect the health status of FM patients.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the provided context, fibromyalgia (FM)-related oxidative stress appears to be implicated in the decline of both physical and mental health status. The study indicates that FM patients exhibit increased oxidative DNA damage and protein carbonyl content, which are markers of oxidative stress. Additionally, there are significant correlations observed between oxidative DNA damage and mental health status (MCS-12) and between zinc levels (which are lower in FM patients) and physical health status (PCS-12). These findings suggest that oxidative stress could play a role in the decline of both physical and mental health in fibromyalgia patients."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: The literature is inconsistent as to whether HIV-infected patients have higher rates of surgical complication rates than HIV-uninfected patients. This inconsistency reflects the failure to control for confounding variables in many of the previous studies. A retrospective cohort study of records of HIV-infected individuals who underwent surgical procedures between 1990 and 1995 was matched with the records of HIV-uninfected control patients. We performed a logistic regression analysis to determine the independent effects of HIV infection and other potential risk factors for surgical complications. The crude rates of death and infectious and hematologic complications were higher among HIV-infected patients than among uninfected patients. Although the crude risk of having any complication was higher among the HIV-infected (odds ratio [OR]=2.47, p=0.015), the adjusted risk was not (OR=0.72 [p<0.613]).

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: To assess the importance of intraoperative management of recipient hemodynamics for immediate versus delayed graft function. The retrospective study of 1966 consecutive renal transplants performed in our department between June 1980 and December 2009 analyzed several perioperative hemodynamic factors: central venous pressure (CVP), mean arterial pressure (MAP) as well as volumes of fluids, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), albumin, and whole blood transfusions. We examined their influence on renal graft function parameters: immediate diuresis, serum creatinine levels, acute rejection, chronic transplant dysfunction, and graft survival. Mean CVP was 9.23 \u00b1 2.65 mm Hg and its variations showed no impact on graft function. We verified a twofold greater risk of chronic allograft dysfunction among patients with CVP \u2265 11 mm Hg (P<.001). Mean MAP was 93.74 \u00b1 13.6 mm Hg; graft survivals among subjects with MAP \u2265 93 mm Hg were greater than those of patients with MAP<93 mm Hg (P = .04). On average, 2303.6 \u00b1 957.4 mL of saline solutions were infused during surgery. Patients who received whole blood transfusions (48%) showed a greater incidence of acute rejection episodes (ARE) (P = .049) and chronic graft dysfunction (P<.001). Patients who received FFP (55.7%), showed a higher incidence of ARE (P<.001). Only 4.6% of patients (n = 91) received human albumin with a lower incidence of ARE (P = .045) and chronic graft dysfunction (P = .024). Logistic binary regression analysis revealed that plasma administration was an independent risk factor for ARE (P<.001) and chronic dysfunction (P = .028). Volume administration (\u2265 2500 mL) was also an independent risk factor for chronic allograft dysfunction (P = .016). Using Cox regression, we verified volume administration \u2265 2500 mL to be the only independent risk factor for graft failure (P<.001).\nQuestion: Do intraoperative hemodynamic factors of the recipient influence renal graft function?", "gt": "MAP \u2265 93 mm Hg and perioperative fluid administration<2500 mL were associated with greater graft survival.

The study shows that certain hemodynamic factors and volume administration practices have significant impacts on various aspects of graft function:\n\n1. **Central Venous Pressure (CVP):** While variations in CVP did not impact immediate graft function, a CVP \u2265 11 mm Hg was associated with a twofold greater risk of chronic allograft dysfunction.\n\n2. **Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP):** Patients with a MAP \u2265 93 mm Hg showed better graft survival compared to those with a MAP < 93 mm Hg.\n\n3. **Volume Administration:** Administering volumes \u2265 2500 mL was identified as an independent risk factor for chronic allograft dysfunction and graft failure.\n\n4. **Types of Fluids Administered:**\n   - Patients receiving whole blood transfusions had a higher incidence of acute rejection episodes and chronic graft dysfunction.\n   - Those receiving fresh frozen plasma (FFP) showed a higher incidence of acute rejection episodes.\n   - Patients receiving human albumin had a lower incidence of acute rejection episodes and chronic graft dysfunction.\n\nIn summary, the intraoperative management of recipient hemodynamics, including the specific types and volumes of fluids administered, plays a critical role in the immediate and long-term function of renal grafts."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: There is extensive evidence that major depression, and particularly melancholia, is characterized by hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis hyperactivity as well as systemic immune activation, which may be accompanied by increased interleukin-1 beta production. Interleukin-1 beta is known to enhance HPA axis activity during an immune response. This study investigated whether interleukin-1 beta production is related to HPA axis activity in depressed subjects. The subjects were 28 inpatients with major or minor depression and 10 normal comparison subjects. The authors measured 1) the subjects' cortisol levels after an overnight 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test (DST) and 2) mitogen-stimulated supernatant interleukin-1 beta production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Statistically significant positive correlations between interleukin-1 beta production and post-DST cortisol values were found in the study group as a whole and in the depressed and normal subgroups separately.\nQuestion: Interleukin-1 beta: a putative mediator of HPA axis hyperactivity in major depression?", "gt": "It is suggested that constituents of the immune response (such as interleukin-1 beta) in major depression may contribute to HPA axis hyperfunction in that illness.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the context provided, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\u03b2) appears to be a potential mediator of HPA axis hyperactivity in major depression.

A randomized controlled study, comprised of 420 pre-eclamptic or eclamptic women with singleton pregnancy 24 weeks gestation and more. Patients were divided into two groups: 220 patients underwent immediate postpartum curettage and 200 patients as a control group. The clinical and laboratory prenatal parameters showed no statistical significant differences between both groups. The follow-up for the postnatal clinical and laboratory data showed significant improvement for the mean arterial blood pressure in the curettage group over 6, 12, and 24 h after delivery and significant improvement in the platelet count as well. The average time required for MAP to reach 105 mmHg or less was significantly shorter (P<0.05) in the curettage group (40 \u00b1 3.15 h) than the control group (86 \u00b1 5.34 h).

The idea of paying patients an incentive to participate in research is controversial, and evidence is needed to evaluate this as a recruitment strategy. In this study, we sought to assess the impact on clinical trial recruitment of a \u00a3100 incentive payment and whether the offer of this payment attracted more elderly and socially deprived patients. A total of 1,015 potential patients for five clinical trials (SCOT, FAST and PATHWAY 1, 2 and 3) were randomised to receive either a standard trial invitation letter or a trial invitation letter containing an incentive offer of \u00a3100. To receive payment, patients had to attend a screening visit and consent to be screened (that is, sign a consent form). To maintain equality, eventually all patients who signed a consent form were paid \u00a3100. The \u00a3100 incentive offer increased positive response to the first invitation letter from 24.7% to 31.6%, an increase of 6.9% (P\u2009<\u20090.05). The incentive offer increased the number of patients signing a consent form by 5.1% (P\u2009<\u20090.05). The mean age of patients who responded positively to the invitation letter was 66.5\u2009\u00b1\u20098.7 years, whereas those who responded negatively were significantly older, with a mean age of 68.9\u2009\u00b1\u20099.0 years.

Information gathered included information about smoking behaviour, educational level and background characteristics. The associations between educational level and smoking rates were assessed using logistic regression analyses stratified by age and sex, for each ethnic group separately. The prevalence of smoking differed per group, being highest among Turkish and Surinamese men (63% and 55%, respectively), followed by Moroccan men and Turkish and Surinamese women (30%, 32% and 27%, respectively). Higher smoking rates were found among women with higher educational levels, except for Surinamese women aged 35-44 years.

Between February 2006 and September 2011, 27 patients (26 men; 1 woman) were implanted with a continuous flow LVAD (HeartMate II, Thoratec Corporation, Pleasanton, CA, USA). The mean age was 55.7 \u00b1 9.9 years. The mean duration of support was 479 \u00b1 436 (1-1555) days with 35.4 patient-years on support. Twenty-one patients were implanted as a bridge to transplantation and 6 for destination therapy. The anticoagulation regimen was fluindione for all patients, with aspirin for only 4 patients. At the beginning of our experience, aspirin was administered to 4 patients for 6, 15, 60 and 460 days. Due to gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and epistaxis, aspirin was discontinued, and since August 2006, no patients have received anti-platelet therapy. At 3 years, the survival rate during support was 76%. The most common postoperative adverse event was GI bleeding (19%) and epistaxis (30%) (median time: 26 days) for patients receiving fluindione and aspirin. The mean International Normalized Ratio (INR) was 2.58 \u00b1 0.74 during support. Fifteen patients have been tested for acquired Von Willebrand disease. A diminished ratio of collagen-binding capacity and ristocetin cofactor activity to Von Willebrand factor antigen was observed in 7 patients. In the postoperative period, 2 patients presented with ischaemic stroke at 1 and 8 months. One of these 2 patients had a previous history of carotid stenosis with ischaemic stroke. There were no patients with haemorrhagic stroke, transient ischaemic attack or pump thrombosis.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: In recent years, Performance Based Financing (PBF); a form of result based financing, has attracted a global attention in health systems in developing countries. PBF promotes autonomous health facilities, motivates and introduces financial incentives to motivate health facilities and health workers to attain pre-determined targets. To achieve this, the Tanzanian government through the Christian Social Services Commission initiated a PBF pilot project in Rungwe district, Mbeya region. Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Center was given the role of training health workers on PBF principles in Rungwe. The aim of this study was to explore health care providers' perception on a three years training on PBF principles in a PBF pilot project at Rungwe District in Mbeya, Tanzania. This was an explorative qualitative study, which took place at Rungwe PBF pilot area in October 2012. Twenty six (26) participants were purposively selected. Six took part in- depth interviews (IDIs) and twenty (20) in the group discussions. Both the IDIs and the GDs explored the perceived benefit and challenges of implementing PBF in their workplace. Data were manually analyzed using content analysis approach. Overall informants had positive perspectives on PBF training. Most of the health facilities were able to implement some of the PBF concepts in their work places after the training, such as developing job descriptions for their staff, creating quarterly business plans for their facilities, costing for their services and entering service agreement with the government, improved record keeping, customer care and involving community as partners in running their facilities. The most common principle of paying individual performance bonuses was mentioned as a major challenge due to inadequate funding and poor design of Rungwe PBF pilot project.\nQuestion: Does training on performance based financing make a difference in performance and quality of health care delivery?", "gt": "Despite poor design and inadequate funding, our findings have shown some promising results after PBF training in the study area.

This challenge was attributed to inadequate funding and poor design of the PBF pilot project. This indicates that while training can lead to positive changes, the sustainability and full realization of PBF's benefits depend on adequate funding and well-designed implementation frameworks.\n\nOverall, the training seems to have facilitated positive changes in health care delivery practices, although the full impact of PBF on performance and quality may be contingent upon overcoming financial and design challenges."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: The uneven distribution of allied health professionals (AHPs) in rural and remote Australia and other countries is well documented. In Australia, like elsewhere, service delivery to rural and remote communities is complicated because relatively small numbers of clients are dispersed over large geographic areas. This uneven distribution of AHPs impacts significantly on the provision of services particularly in areas of special need such as mental health, aged care and disability services. This study aimed to determine the relative importance that AHPs (physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech pathologists and psychologists - \"therapists\") living in a rural area of Australia and working with people with disability, place on different job characteristics and how these may affect their retention. A cross-sectional survey was conducted using an online questionnaire distributed to AHPs working with people with disability in a rural area of Australia over a 3-month period. Information was sought about various aspects of the AHPs' current job, and their workforce preferences were explored using a best-worst scaling discrete choice experiment (BWSDCE). Conditional logistic and latent class regression models were used to determine AHPs' relative preferences for six different job attributes. One hundred ninety-nine AHPs completed the survey; response rate was 51 %. Of those, 165 completed the BWSDCE task. For this group of AHPs, \"high autonomy of practice\" is the most valued attribute level, followed by \"travel BWSDCE arrangements: one or less nights away per month\", \"travel arrangements: two or three nights away per month\" and \"adequate access to professional development\". On the other hand, the least valued attribute levels were \"travel arrangements: four or more nights per month\", \"limited autonomy of practice\" and \"minimal access to professional development\".

These factors are crucial for job satisfaction and retention.\n\nIf an AHP is considering whether to stay in their current rural or remote job, they should evaluate how well their current work environment aligns with these valued attributes. For instance, if the job provides high autonomy, limited travel requirements, and opportunities for professional growth, it is likely that the AHP would be more inclined to stay. Conversely, if the job involves frequent travel, limited autonomy, and restricted access to professional development, the AHP might be more inclined to seek employment elsewhere.\n\nMoreover, personal factors such as age, marital status, and whether they have dependent children also influence preferences. Younger AHPs, those who are married, and those with children might have different priorities that affect their decision to stay or go, such as the need for more job flexibility or proximity to family and support networks.\n\nIn summary, the decision to stay or go is deeply personal and depends on how well the job aligns with the AHP's professional and personal needs, particularly in terms of job autonomy, travel requirements, professional development opportunities, and personal life circumstances."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Defocus curves are used to evaluate the subjective range of clear vision of presbyopic corrections such as in eyes implanted with accommodating intraocular lenses (IOLs). This study determines whether letter sequences and/or lens presentation order ought to be randomised when measuring defocus curves. Defocus curves (range +2.00DS to -2.00DS) were measured on 18 pre-presbyopic subjects (mean age 24.1+/-4.2 years) for six combinations of sequential or randomised positive or negative lens progression and non-randomised or randomised letter sequences. The letters were presented on a computerised logMAR chart at 6m. Overall there was a statistically significant difference between the six combinations (ANOVA, p<0.05) attributable to the combination of non-randomised letters with non-randomised lens progression from negative to positive defocus (p<0.01). There was no statistically significant difference in defocus curve measurements if both letters and lens order were randomised compared to if only one of these variables was randomised (p>0.05). Non-randomised letters, with a sequential lens progression from negative to positive, was significantly different to all other combinations when compared individually (Student's T-test, p<0.003 on all comparisons), and was confirmed as the sole source of the overall significant difference. There was no statistically significant difference if both lens presentation order and letter sequences were randomised compared to if only one or the other of these variables was randomised.\nQuestion: Is randomisation necessary for measuring defocus curves in pre-presbyopes?", "gt": "Non-randomised letters and non-randomised lens progression on their own did not affect the subjective amplitude of accommodation as measured by defocus curves, although their combination should be avoided.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the context provided, randomization of either the letter sequences or the lens presentation order (or both) appears to be important for accurate measurement of defocus curves in pre-presbyopes.

However, when either the letters or the lens order (or both) are randomized, there is no statistically significant difference in the defocus curve measurements compared to when only one of these variables is randomized. Therefore, randomization is necessary to avoid bias in the measurement of defocus curves, ensuring more reliable and consistent results."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Cardiovascular fitness (VO(2max)) and physical activity are both related to risk of metabolic disease. It is unclear, however, whether the metabolic effects of sedentary living are the same in fit and unfit individuals. The purpose of this study was, therefore, to describe the association between physical activity and the metabolic syndrome and to test whether fitness level modifies this relationship. Physical activity was measured objectively using individually calibrated heart rate against energy expenditure. VO(2max) was predicted from a submaximal exercise stress test. Fat mass and fat-free mass (FFM) were calculated using impedance biometry. A metabolic syndrome score was computed by summing the standardized values for obesity, hypertension, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, hypertriglyceridemia, and the inverse level of HDL cholesterol and was expressed as a continuously distributed outcome. To correct for exposure measurement error, a random subsample (22% of cohort) re-attended for three repeat measurements in the year following the first assessment. The relationship of VO(2max) (ml O2.kg(FFM)(-1).min(-1)) and the metabolic syndrome score was of borderline significance after adjusting for age, sex, physical activity, and measurement error (beta = -0.58, P = 0.06). The magnitude of the association between physical activity (kJ.d(-1).kg(FFM)(-1)) and the metabolic syndrome was more than three times greater than for VO(2max) (standardized beta = -1.83, P = 0.0042). VO(2max), however, modified the relationship between physical activity energy expenditure and metabolic syndrome (P = 0.036).\nQuestion: Does the association of habitual physical activity with the metabolic syndrome differ by level of cardiorespiratory fitness?", "gt": "This study demonstrates a strong inverse association between physical activity and metabolic syndrome, an association that is much steeper in unfit individuals. Thus, prevention of metabolic disease may be most effective in the subset of unfit inactive people.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Yes, the association of habitual physical activity with the metabolic syndrome does differ by level of cardiorespiratory fitness. The study found that VO2max (a measure of cardiorespiratory fitness) modifies the relationship between physical activity energy expenditure and the metabolic syndrome.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: It is still unclear whether the inlay thickness is an important factor influencing the fracture risk of ceramic inlays. As high tensile stresses increase the fracture risk of ceramic inlays, the objective of the present finite element method (FEM) study was to biomechanically analyze the correlation between inlay thickness (T) and the induced first principal stress. Fourteen ceramic inlay models with varying thickness (0.7-2.0 mm) were generated. All inlays were combined with a CAD model of a first mandibular molar (tooth 46), including the PDL and a mandibular segment which was created by means of the CT data of an anatomical specimen. Two materials were defined for the ceramic inlays (e.max(\u00ae) or empress(\u00ae)) and an occlusal force of 100 N was applied. The first principal stress was measured within each inlay and the peak values were considered and statistically analyzed. The stress medians ranged from 20.7 to 22.1 MPa in e.max(\u00ae) and from 27.6 to 29.2 MPa in empress(\u00ae) inlays. A relevant correlation between the first principal stress and thickness (T) could not be detected, neither for e.max(\u00ae) (Spearman: r=0.028, p=0.001), nor for empress(\u00ae) (Spearman: r=0.010, p=0.221). In contrast, a very significant difference (p<0.001) between the two inlay materials (M) was verified.\nQuestion: Ceramic inlays: is the inlay thickness an important factor influencing the fracture risk?", "gt": "Under the conditions of the present FEM study, the inlay thickness does not seem to be an important factor influencing the fracture risk of ceramic inlays.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Reactive oxygen species have been shown to be initiators/promotors of tumorigenesis. Because evidence supports the role of increased oxidative stress in solid tumors, we sought to establish this relationship in neuroblastoma (NB). The aim of the study was to investigate the extent of oxidative DNA damage and antioxidative status in a progressive animal model of human NB. Tumors were induced in the left kidneys of nude mice by the injection of cultured human NB cells (10(6)). Blood was collected from tumor-bearing mice and controls at 2, 4, and 6 weeks. Peripheral blood leukocyte oxidative DNA damage was determined using single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay), and plasma antioxidant capacity was assessed by the Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity method. Levels of oxidative DNA damage in peripheral blood leukocytes of NB-bearing mice were increased by 166%, 110%, and 87% as compared with healthy controls at 2, 4, and 6 weeks, respectively. Plasma total antioxidant values for tumor-bearing mice were not significantly different from control mice.\nQuestion: Oxidative status in neuroblastoma: a source of stress?", "gt": "Our results indicate an increase of oxidative stress in an animal model of human NB, especially in the early stages of growth.

At 2, 4, and 6 weeks post-tumor induction, the levels of oxidative DNA damage increased by 166%, 110%, and 87%, respectively. This suggests that the presence of neuroblastoma tumors is associated with elevated oxidative stress, which can lead to increased DNA damage. However, the plasma total antioxidant capacity did not show a significant difference between tumor-bearing mice and controls, indicating that while oxidative stress is elevated, the overall systemic antioxidant capacity might not be significantly altered. This imbalance between oxidative stress and antioxidant defenses could contribute to the progression of neuroblastoma."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: To compare the diagnostic accuracy of standard (st) and long-term video (lt) EEG in elderly patients with suspected non-convulsive seizures. Over a 12-month period, we prospectively included all elderly (over-65) hospitalized patients having undergone lt-EEG for suspected non-convulsive seizures (n=43). st-EEG was defined as the first 20min of each lt-EEG. We recorded the patients' clinical and imaging characteristics and final diagnosis and assessed the respective diagnostic values of st-EEG and lt-EEG. Epileptiform discharges were detected on standard EEG in only 7% of patients and in 28% of patients on Lt-EEG (p=0.004). Non-convulsive seizures were recorded in 1 case vs. 4, respectively. Nine of 40 negative standard EEG showed later epileptiform activities. The median time to occurrence of the first epileptiform activities was 46.5min (interquartile range: 36.5-239.75min).

Ecological study of routinely collected hospital admissions data for falls and hip fracture in people aged 75 years or over for 1992-1997, linked at electoral ward level with characteristics from census data. In total, 42,293 and 17,390 admissions were identified for falls and hip fracture, respectively, from 858 electoral wards in Trent. Rate ratios (RRs) for hospital admissions for falls and hip fracture were calculated by the electoral wards' Townsend score divided by quintiles. RRs were estimated by negative binomial regression and adjusted for the ward characteristics of age, gender, ethnicity, rurality, proportion of elderly people living alone and distance from hospital. There was a small but statistically significant association at electoral ward level between hospital admissions for falls and the Townsend score, with the most deprived wards having a 10% higher admission rate for falls compared with the most affluent wards (adjusted RR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01-1.19).

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: The authors reviewed their institutional experience with pure low-grade oligodendroglioma (LGO), correlating outcomes with several variables of possible prognostic values. Sixty-nine patients with WHO-classified LGOs were treated between 1992 and 2006 at the McGill University Health Center. Clinical, pathological, and radiological records were carefully reviewed. Demographic characteristics; the nature and duration of presenting symptoms; baseline neurological function; extent of resection; Karnofsky Performance Scale score; preoperative radiological findings including tumor size, location, and absence/presence of enhancement; and pathological data including chromosome arms 1p/19q codeletion and O-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter gene methylation status were all compiled. The timing and dose of radio- and/or chemotherapy, date of tumor progression, pathological finding at disease progression, treatment at time of disease progression, and status at the last follow-up were also recorded. The median follow-up period was 6.1 years (range 1.3-16.3 years). The majority (78%) of patients presented with seizures; contrast enhancement was initially seen in 16 patients (25%). All patients had undergone an initial surgical procedure: gross-total resection in 27%, partial resection in 59%, and biopsy only in the remaining 13%. Fifteen patients received adjuvant radiotherapy. Data on O-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter gene methylation status was available in 47 patients (68%) and in all but 1 patient for 1p/19q status. Survival at 5, 10, and 15 years was 83, 63, and 29%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that seizures at presentation and the absence of contrast enhancement were the only independent favorable prognostic factors for survival.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Pretreatment urinary, bowel, and sexual dysfunction may increase the toxicity of prostate cancer treatments or preclude potential benefits. Using patient-reported baseline dysfunction from a prospective cohort study, we determined the proportion of patients receiving relatively contraindicated ('mismatched') treatments. Baseline obstructive uropathy and bowel dysfunction relatively contraindicate brachytherapy (BT) and external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), respectively, because they increase patients' vulnerability to treatment-related toxicity. Baseline sexual dysfunction renders moot the intended benefit of nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy (NSRP), which is to preserve sexual function. We categorized patients' clinical circumstances by increasing complexity and counted the mismatches in each, expecting weaker or multiple contraindications to increase mismatched treatments. Of 438 eligible patients, 389 (89%) reported preexisting dysfunction, and more than one-third received mismatched treatments. Mismatches did not significantly increase with clinical complexity, and watchful waiting was very infrequent, even when all treatment options were contraindicated. Patient age and comorbidity, but not preexisting dysfunction, were associated with treatment choice.

We sought to determine the risk of HAI and SSI in surgical patients undergoing elective inpatient joint replacement, coronary artery bypass grafting, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, colectomy, and hernia repair. The Nationwide Inpatient Sample was analyzed (years 2007 and 2008). HAI were defined as health care-associated pneumonia, sepsis, SSI, and urinary tract infection. Primary outcomes were risk of HAI and SSI in patients with AUD. Secondary outcomes were mortality and hospital length of stay in patients with HAI and SSI, alpha = 10(-6). There were 1,275,034 inpatient admissions analyzed; 38,335 (3.0%) cases of HAI were documented, and 5,756 (0.5%) cases of SSI were identified. AUD was diagnosed in 11,640 (0.9%) of cases. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that AUD was an independent predictor of developing HAI: odds ratio (OR) 1.70, p<10(-6), and this risk was independent of type of surgery. By multivariable analysis, the risk of SSI in patients with AUD was also higher: OR 2.73, p<10(-6). Hospital mortality in patients with HAI or SSI was not affected by AUD.

Specifically, the heart rate recovery 1 minute after exercise was reduced from 23.4 \u00b1 6.4 to 20.5 \u00b1 4.9 after the influenza vaccination, indicating a temporary attenuation of parasympathetic reactivation."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: A network of Stop Smoking Services has been set up within the National Health Service (NHS) in England. The services deliver a combination of behavioural support and medication. It is important to establish the degree of variability in quit rates attributable to differences between individual practitioners, to gauge the scope for improvement by training and professional support. The aim of the present analysis was to examine how far short-term quit rates depend on the practitioner delivering the intervention after adjusting for potential confounding variables. Observational study using routinely collected data. Thirty-one NHS Stop Smoking Services in England. Data from 46,237 one-to-one treatment episodes (supported quit attempts) delivered by specialist practitioners. Three-level logistic regression models were fitted for carbon monoxide (CO)-validated short-term (4-week) quit rates. Models adjusted for age, gender, exemption from prescription charges, medication and intervention setting for each treatment episode, number of clients for each practitioner and economic deprivation at the level of the Stop Smoking Service. Secondary analyses included (i) the heaviness-of-smoking index (HSI) as predictor and (ii) 4-week quit rates whether or not confirmed by CO. Differences between individual specialist practitioners explained 7.6% of the variance in CO-verified quit rates after adjusting for client demographics, intervention characteristics and practitioner and service variables (P\u2009<\u20090.001). HSI had little impact on this figure; in quits not necessarily validated by CO, practitioners explained less variance.\nQuestion: Does it matter who you see to help you stop smoking?", "gt": "Individual stop smoking practitioners appear to differ to a significant degree in effectiveness. It is important to examine what underlies these differences in order to improve selection, training and professional development.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Yes, it does matter who you see to help you stop smoking. The study indicates that differences between individual practitioners can explain about 7.6% of the variance in carbon monoxide (CO)-verified quit rates, even after adjusting for various factors such as client demographics, intervention characteristics, and other practitioner and service-related variables. This suggests that the specific practitioner providing the support can influence the success rate of quitting smoking, highlighting the importance of the practitioner's role in the effectiveness of the stop smoking services."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Previous studies reporting the impact of osteoarthritis (OA) on pain and function after hip arthroscopy largely predate resection of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI).QUESTIONS/ We determined (1) functional improvement after resection of FAI impingement lesions in patients with preoperative radiographic joint space narrowing, and (2) identified preoperative predictors of pain, function, and failure rates in these patients. Between September 2004 and April 2008, we treated 210 patients (227 hips) with FAI and a minimum 12-month followup (mean, 27 months). Group FAI consisted of 154 patients (169 hips) without radiographic joint space narrowing, whereas Group FAI-OA consisted of 56 patients (58 hips) with preoperative radiographic joint space narrowing. We collected Harris hip scores (HHS), Short Form-12 (SF-12), and pain scores on a visual analog scale (VAS) preoperatively and postoperatively. Score improvements were better for Group FAI compared with Group FAI-OA. The overall failure rate was greater for Group FAI-OA (52%) than for Group FAI (12%). Although patients with less than 50% joint space narrowing or greater than 2 mm joint space remaining on preoperative radiographs had improved scores throughout the study, we observed no score improvements at any time with advanced preoperative joint space narrowing. Greater joint space narrowing, advanced MRI chondral grade, and longer duration of preoperative symptoms predicted lower scores.\nQuestion: Does arthroscopic FAI correction improve function with radiographic arthritis?", "gt": "FAI correction with milder degrees of preoperative radiographic joint space narrowing resulted in improvements in pain and function at short-term followup. Patients with advanced radiographic joint space narrowing do not improve and we believe should not be considered for arthroscopic FAI correction.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the context provided, arthroscopic correction of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) does lead to functional improvement, but this improvement is notably less in patients with preoperative radiographic joint space narrowing, which is indicative of osteoarthritis (OA). The study found that patients without radiographic joint space narrowing (Group FAI) had better score improvements compared to those with radiographic joint space narrowing (Group FAI-OA). Additionally, patients with less than 50% joint space narrowing or more than 2 mm joint space remaining showed improvements, but those with advanced preoperative joint space narrowing did not see any score improvements at any point in the study.\n\nIn conclusion, while FAI correction can improve function, the presence of radiographic arthritis (joint space narrowing) significantly limits the extent of functional improvement, especially in cases of advanced arthritis."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Recently there has been growing interest in how neighbourhood features, such as the provision of local facilities and amenities, influence residents' health and well-being. Prior research has measured amenity provision through subjective measures (surveying residents' perceptions) or objective (GIS mapping of distance) methods. The latter may provide a more accurate measure of physical access, but residents may not use local amenities if they do not perceive them as 'local'. We believe both subjective and objective measures should be explored, and use West Central Scotland data to investigate correspondence between residents' subjective assessments of how well-placed they are for everyday amenities (food stores, primary and secondary schools, libraries, pharmacies, public recreation), and objective GIS-modelled measures, and examine correspondence by various sub-groups. ArcMap was used to map the postal locations of 'Transport, Health and Well-being 2010 Study' respondents (n = 1760), and the six amenities, and the presence/absence of each of them within various straight-line and network buffers around respondents' homes was recorded. SPSS was used to investigate whether objective presence of an amenity within a specified buffer was perceived by a respondent as being well-placed for that amenity. Kappa statistics were used to test agreement between measures for all respondents, and by sex, age, social class, area deprivation, car ownership, dog ownership, walking in the local area, and years lived in current home. In general, there was poor agreement (Kappa<0.20) between perceptions of being well-placed for each facility and objective presence, within 800 m and 1000 m straight-line and network buffers, with the exception of pharmacies (at 1000 m straight-line) (Kappa: 0.21). Results varied between respondent sub-groups, with some showing better agreement than others. Amongst sub-groups, at 800 m straight-line buffers, the highest correspondence between subjective and objective measures was for pharmacies and primary schools, and at 1000 m, for pharmacies, primary schools and libraries. For road network buffers under 1000 m, agreement was generally poor.\nQuestion: Do residents' perceptions of being well-placed and objective presence of local amenities match?", "gt": "Respondents did not necessarily regard themselves as well-placed for specific amenities when these amenities were present within specified boundaries around their homes, with some exceptions; the picture is not clear-cut with varying findings between different amenities, buffers, and sub-groups.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the provided context, there is generally poor agreement between residents' perceptions of being well-placed for local amenities and the objective presence of these amenities, as measured using straight-line and network buffers.

However, there were some exceptions where the correspondence was slightly better, such as for pharmacies within a 1000 m straight-line buffer, where the Kappa statistic was 0.21. The agreement also varied by respondent sub-groups, with some groups showing better agreement than others, particularly for pharmacies, primary schools, and libraries. Overall, the findings suggest that subjective and objective measures of amenity access are not strongly aligned, indicating that residents' perceptions play a significant role in how they assess the availability and convenience of local amenities."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Increasing evidence suggests a close association between early sexual maturation (SM) and obesity in girls and female adults. Earlier maturing girls are more likely to be obese than nonearly maturers. However, limited research has been conducted in boys. To examine the influence of early SM on fatness in boys and compare it with girls, and to test the hypothesis that the associations differ by gender because of the differences in growth and SM patterns in boys and girls. Cross-sectional study. One thousand five hundred one girls and 1520 boys (aged 8-14 years) who participated in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey survey (1988-1994) and had complete anthropometry (weight, height, skinfold thickness) and SM data. Based on each individual's age and SM status (Tanner stages: genitalia stages for boys and breast stages for girls), the subjects were classified as: 1) early maturers (those who reached a certain Tanner stage earlier than the median age for that stage), and 2) the others (average and later maturers). Overweight was defined as a body mass index (BMI)>or =85th percentile, and obesity>or =95th percentile. Logistic regression analysis was to test how early maturation affected the risks for overweight and obese. Using multiple linear regression models, the associations between fatness (BMI and skinfold thickness) and SM were systematically examined. Covariates including age, ethnicity, residence, family income, energy intake, and physical activity were adjusted. Early SM was positively associated with overweight and obesity in girls, but the associations were reverse for boys. The prevalence of overweight in early maturers versus the others was 22.6% versus 31.6% in boys and 34.4% versus 23.2% in girls; the figures for obesity were 6.7% versus 14.8% and 15.6% versus 8.1%, respectively. Odd ratios and 95% confidence intervals for obesity were 0.4 (0.2, 0.8) for boys and 2.0 (1.1, 3.5) for girls, and covariates were adjusted. Most significant differences in overweight and obesity among ethnic groups disappeared after controlling for SM. Fatness (BMI and skinfold thickness) was associated with SM stages and with early maturation in boys and girls, but the associations were in opposite directions. Compared with their counterparts, early maturing boys were thinner, whereas early maturing girls were fatter.\nQuestion: Is obesity associated with early sexual maturation?", "gt": "Obesity is associated with sexual maturation in both boys and girls, but the association differs.

For girls, early sexual maturation is positively associated with overweight and obesity. However, for boys, the association is reversed; early maturing boys are less likely to be overweight or obese compared to their peers who mature later. The data indicates that early maturing girls have a higher prevalence of obesity (15.6% versus 8.1% for non-early maturers), while for boys, the prevalence of obesity is lower in early maturing boys (6.7% versus 14.8% for non-early maturers). Therefore, while early sexual maturation is associated with increased risk of obesity in girls, it is associated with a decreased risk of obesity in boys."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: To compare the efficacy of Valsalva maneuver and pneumatic compression techniques in detecting lower extremity deep venous and saphenofemoral insufficiency. Eighty-one extremities evaluated in 43 patients who had undergone Doppler ultrasound examination of the lower extremity venous system were included in the study. Valsalva maneuver and pneumatic cuff techniques were used to elicit reflux in the standing position. Reflux was investigated with spectral Doppler in the superficial femoral vein, popliteal vein, the proximal segment of the great saphenous vein close to its junction with the femoral vein and in its caudal segment at the medial aspect of the knee. The same measurements were repeated after rapid deflation of the pneumatic cuff, which was applied to the calf and was initially inflated to 200 mmHg. Retrograde flow exceeding 1000 msec was regarded as insufficiency. The results of the two techniques at each venous segment were compared with the McNemar test. Deep venous and/or saphenofemoral insufficiency were detected in 61 of the 81 extremities. The cuff deflation technique was superior at the popliteal vein and caudal segment of the great saphenous vein. The Valsalva maneuver was superior at the superficial femoral vein. The statistical results did not change when the McNemar test was repeated for reflux exceeding 2000 msec.\nQuestion: Doppler ultrasound diagnosis of lower extremity deep vein insufficiency: Valsalva maneuver or pneumatic cuff?", "gt": "Combined application of Valsalva maneuver and pneumatic cuff techniques will lead to more accurate evaluation and increased detection of lower extremity venous insufficiency.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the provided context, both the Valsalva maneuver and the pneumatic cuff technique are used in the diagnosis of lower extremity deep vein insufficiency, but each shows superiority in different segments of the venous system.

Conversely, the Valsalva maneuver was superior for detecting insufficiency in the superficial femoral vein. Therefore, the choice between the two methods might depend on which specific segment of the venous system is of primary interest in a given clinical scenario."}

The on-demand visits of patients over 14 to the General Medicine and Emergency clinics between June 1991 and May 1992 provided the data through a simple multi-stage random sample. On the basis of the clinical notes, these variables were recorded: age, gender, diagnosis, the antibiotic prescribed and its manner of administration. The indication and choice of treatment was assessed in line with previously established criteria, as well as whether the antibiotic was first-choice in Primary Care. Infections treated in hospital or by specialists, non-bacterial cutaneous infections and Conjunctivitis were excluded. Out of 2,523 people examined, 474 presented infectious conditions (18.8%); the most common of these were infections of the upper respiratory tract (46.4%) and acute Bronchitis (17.3%). An antibiotic was prescribed in 206 cases (43.3%). The most used antibiotics were: Amoxicillin (41.5%), Penicillin (19.0%), Cloxacillin (11.2%), Erythromycin (10.2%) and Pipemidic Acid (7.8%). They were orally taken in 89.4% of cases. 92.3% of the antibiotics were first-choice. Overall fitness of treatment was 86.3% (56.5% unnecessary and non-prescribed treatment; and 29.7% necessary and using the recommended antibiotic). The least suitable treatment was observed for cases of acute Bronchitis without any risk factors.\nQuestion: Are antibiotics correctly prescribed in primary care?", "gt": "Prescriptions are adjusted to the recommendations on antibiotic policy in Primary Care, although less suitable treatment was observed for acute Bronchitis.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: The critical shortage of surgeons and access to surgical care in Africa is increasingly being recognized as a global health crisis. Across Africa, there is only one surgeon for every 250,000 people and only one for every 2.5 million of those living in rural areas. Surgical diseases are responsible for approximately 11.2% of the total global burden of disease. Even as the importance of treating surgical disease is being recognized, surgeons in sub-Saharan Africa are leaving rural areas and their countries altogether to practice in more desirable locations. The Pan-African Academy of Christian Surgeons (PAACS) was formed in 1997 as a strategic response to this profound need for surgical manpower. It is training surgical residents through a 5-year American competency-based model. Trainees are required to be of African origin and a graduate of a recognized medical school. To date, PAACS has established six training programs in four countries. During the 2009-2010 academic year, there were 35 residents in training. A total of 18 general surgeons and one pediatric surgeon have been trained. Two more general surgeons are scheduled to finish training in 2011.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Breast cancer is characterized by hormone dependency, and endocrine therapy is a key treatment in breast cancer. Recently, targeted therapies such as Trastuzumab treatment for HER2-positive breast cancer has been important. Triple-negative (TN) breast cancer is characterized by lack of expression of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PgR), and the absence of HER2 protein overexpression, and so there is no targeted therapy for this subtype. In this study, we examined the biological and prognostic characteristics in TN breast cancer. Between January 1998 and September 2006, 1,552 patients with primary breast cancer were investigated retrospectively in this study and ER, PgR and HER2 status were evaluated in all cases. Furthermore, p53 overexpression and Ki67 values were examined immunohistochemically. Patient distribution according to ER, PgR or HER2 status was as follows: ER and PgR positive: 57.9%, and ER and PgR negative: 25.1%. With regards to the HER2 status, HER2 positive was 23.3%, and triple negative (TN) was 14.0%. TN breast cancer has a high proliferation rate, high nuclear grade and frequent p53 overexpression. Patients with TN tumors had a significantly poorer disease-free survival (DFS) than those with non-TN tumors. After recurrence the overall survival (OS) rate in TN cases was significantly lower than that of the non-TN cases. Multivariate analysis revealed that TN was a significant factor for DFS and OS after recurrence.\nQuestion: Is triple negative a prognostic factor in breast cancer?", "gt": "TN breast cancer is a rare subtype with a high proliferation rate and a high nuclear grade, p53 overexpression, and lower DFS/OS.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: The effect on resident behaviors of adding a wander garden to an existing dementia facility was investigated. 34 male residents were observed for 12 months before and after opening the garden. Behaviors were assessed using the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory Short Form (CMAI), incident reports, as needed medications (pro re nata [PRN]), and surveys of staff and residents' family members as indices of affect. Final CMAI scores and total PRNs employed were lower than baseline values with a trend for residents who used the garden more often to have less agitated behavior. Verbal inappropriate behaviors did not change significantly whereas physical incidents increased. Staff and family members felt that the wander garden decreased inappropriate behaviors and improved mood and quality of life of the dementia residents.\nQuestion: Does a wander garden influence inappropriate behaviors in dementia residents?", "gt": "Study design characteristics and garden management may have affected behaviors both positively and negatively.

The overall influence on inappropriate behaviors is thus nuanced, with both positive and potentially mixed outcomes."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: The role of combined endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) and endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) with a single bronchoscope is poorly understood. The purpose of the present study was to elucidate the roles of EBUS-TBNA and EUS-FNA with a single bronchoscope in the preoperative hilar and mediastinal staging of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A total of 150 patients with potentially resectable known or suspected NSCLC were enrolled in our prospective study. EBUS-TBNA was performed, followed by EUS-FNA, with an EBUS bronchoscope for N2 and N3 nodes\u22655 mm in the shortest diameter on ultrasound images, in a single session. EBUS-TBNA was performed for 257 lymph nodes and EUS-FNA for 176 lymph nodes. Of the 150 patients, 146 had a final diagnosis of NSCLC. Of these 146 patients, 33 (23%) had N2 and/or N3 nodal metastases. The sensitivity of EBUS-TBNA, EUS-FNA, and the combined approach per patient was 52%, 45%, and 73%, respectively (EBUS-TBNA vs the combined approach, P=.016, McNemar's test). The corresponding negative predictive value was 88%, 86%, and 93%. Two patients (1%) developed severe cough from EBUS-TBNA.\nQuestion: Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration and endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration: Are two better than one in mediastinal staging of non-small cell lung cancer?", "gt": "The combined endoscopic approach with EBUS-TBNA and EUS-FNA is a safe and accurate method for preoperative hilar and mediastinal staging of NSCLC, with better results than with each technique by itself.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the context provided, it appears that combining endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) and endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) with a single bronchoscope may indeed be more effective than using either technique alone for the mediastinal staging of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n\nIn the study described, the combined approach of EBUS-TBNA and EUS-FNA demonstrated a higher sensitivity (73%) compared to EBUS-TBNA (52%) or EUS-FNA (45%) alone for diagnosing N2 and/or N3 nodal metastases in patients with NSCLC. This suggests that the combined use of both techniques can improve the detection rate of lymph node metastases, which is crucial for accurate staging and treatment planning in NSCLC.\n\nAdditionally, the negative predictive value (NPV) for the combined approach was 93%, which is higher than the NPV for EBUS-TBNA (88%) or EUS-FNA (86%) alone. A higher NPV means that when the test result is negative, it is more likely that the patient truly does not have the condition, which can provide reassurance and guide appropriate management decisions.\n\nThe study also noted that the combined approach was statistically significant in improving sensitivity over EBUS-TBNA alone (P=.016, McNemar's test), further supporting the benefit of using both techniques together.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the combination of these techniques was associated with a small risk of severe cough (1% of patients), which should be considered as part of the risk-benefit analysis when deciding on the staging approach for individual patients.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the data presented, the combined use of EBUS-TBNA and EUS-FNA with a single bronchoscope appears to offer a more accurate and comprehensive approach to mediastinal staging in NSCLC, potentially improving patient outcomes through better diagnosis and treatment planning."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: An increased platelet activation status is present in patients with preeclampsia. Our purpose was (1) to establish by means of flow cytometry whether platelets circulate in an activated state during the first and second trimesters of pregnancy and (2) to establish whether early platelet activation predicts the onset of preeclampsia. Consecutively, 244 pregnant women were included in a prospective study design. Platelets in whole blood samples from the pregnant women in the first trimester, the second trimester, and after delivery were labeled with the following antibodies associated with platelet activation: anti-CD62P (P-selectin, alpha-granule secretion), anti-CD63 (GP53, lysosomal secretion), anti-CD31 (GPIIa', platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1). The surface antigen exposure was determined by double-label flow cytometry with anti-CD42b (GPIb, a platelet-specific monoclonal glycoprotein) to select platelets and platelet-derived materials. Preeclampsia was defined as a diastolic blood pressure>or = 90 mm Hg and proteinuria>or = 0.3 gm in a 24-hour urine sample (International Society for Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy criteria). Seventeen of 244 patients had preeclampsia (6.9%). Only first-trimester CD63 expression had an area under the curve>0.5 by receiver-operator characteristic curve analysis and was selected as a possible predictor of preeclampsia. We found a sensitivity of 47% and a specificity of 76% with use of a percentage of activated platelets above 2% as a positive test. Likelihood ratios were 1.94 for positive likelihood and 0.69 for negative likelihood. Univariate logistic regression analysis results were odds ratio 2.8 (95% confidence interval 1.0 to 7.6). Multivariate logistic regression analysis results were odds ratio 2.9 (95% confidence interval 0.92 to 8.9). However, the odds ratio of first antenatal diastolic blood pressure was two to four times higher than the odds ratio of first-trimester CD63 expression. The combination of first-trimester CD63 and first antenatal diastolic blood pressure increases the positive likelihood ratio from 1.94 to 9.4, with a sensitivity of 41%, a specificity of 96%, and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.62.\nQuestion: Can flow cytometric detection of platelet activation early in pregnancy predict the occurrence of preeclampsia?", "gt": "Increased first-trimester CD63 expression is an independent risk factor for development of preeclampsia. CD63 expression might be useful to identify a subgroup of patients with a high risk for development of preeclampsia, especially in combination with first-trimester antenatal diastolic blood pressure.

The study indicates that an increased expression of CD63, which is associated with lysosomal secretion and thus platelet activation, showed a sensitivity of 47% and a specificity of 76% when the percentage of activated platelets exceeded 2%. This suggests that while CD63 expression alone can indicate a risk of preeclampsia, its predictive power is limited. The odds ratio for first-trimester CD63 expression was found to be 2.9 in multivariate logistic regression analysis, indicating that it is a significant but not the strongest predictor compared to other factors like diastolic blood pressure. Combining the measurement of first-trimester CD63 with the first antenatal diastolic blood pressure measurement enhances the predictive value, increasing the positive likelihood ratio and specificity, while maintaining a reasonable sensitivity and negative likelihood ratio. Thus, while the early detection of platelet activation through CD63 expression can contribute to the prediction of preeclampsia, it is most effective when used in conjunction with other clinical measures."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: To identify patients with ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction who will benefit from endoscopic Acucise incision of the stenosis and to compare the open Hynes-Anderson pyeloplasty with this minimally invasive technique. In a prospective trial, 22 patients with primary and secondary UPJ obstruction were treated by Acucise endopyelotomy, and 18 patients were treated by Hynes-Anderson pyeloplasty. Preoperative and postoperative renal scans were used to determine the degree of obstruction and intravenous urography, ultrasound scanning, or both to assess the degree of dilation. There was a vast difference in the cure rate of the two groups: Hynes-Anderson pyeloplasty cured 94.5% of the patients, while in the Acucise group, the cure rate was only 32%. There was some improvement in another 22% of the patients, but the renal scan curve remained obstructed. The remaining 45% of patients failed to show any improvement.\nQuestion: Retrograde acucise endopyelotomy: is it worth its cost?", "gt": "Acucise endopyelotomy will improve or cure only patients with good renal function and mild dilation of the pelvicaliceal system.

On the other hand, Hynes-Anderson pyeloplasty had a significantly higher cure rate of 94.5%.\n\nGiven these outcomes, the cost-effectiveness of retrograde Acucise endopyelotomy may be questionable, especially when compared to the more effective open Hynes-Anderson pyeloplasty. However, the decision on whether it is worth its cost would also depend on other factors such as the invasiveness of the procedure, patient recovery time, long-term outcomes, and the specific circumstances of each patient. For instance, if the Acucise method is less invasive and has a faster recovery time, it might still be considered in certain cases where the benefits outweigh the lower success rate. Nevertheless, based on the cure rate alone, it seems less favorable."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: The pain-relieving efficacy of antagonists of histamine 1 (H1) receptors that are widely found in the ureter and that cause contractions in renal colic was presented in comparison with a placebo. Eighty-six patients who presented to the emergency service because of renal colic accompanied by nausea, and who had urinary system stones detected were included in the study. The patients were separated into 2 groups by double-blind, random assignment. The 45 patients in group 1 received 50 mg intramuscular (IM) dimenhydrinate. The 41 patients in group 2 received 2 mL IM saline solution as a placebo. The visual analogous scale (VAS) values were detected at referral of the patients and at 10, 20, and 30 minutes of therapy to detect the pain intensity. Verbal descriptive scale (VDS) was used for evaluation of nausea and vomiting before and after the therapy. VAS values were statistically quite low in group 1 at 10, 20, and 30 minutes of therapy. VDS scores were also statistically significantly low in group 1 at 30 minutes of treatment.\nQuestion: Histamine 1 receptor antagonist in symptomatic treatment of renal colic accompanied by nausea: two birds with one stone?", "gt": "Dimenhydrinate, which is an ethanolamine group H1 receptor blocker, appeared to be effective compared with the placebo in relieving renal colic pain and nausea and vomiting symptoms in patients.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: In cardiac hypertrophy, ECG T-wave changes imply an abnormal sequence of ventricular repolarization. We investigated the hypothesis that this is due to changes in the normal regional differences in action potential duration. We assessed the contribution of potassium- and calcium-dependent currents to these differences. Both the altered sequence of ventricular repolarization and the underlying cellular mechanisms may contribute to the increased incidence of ventricular arrhythmias in hypertrophy. Rats received daily isoproterenol injections for 7 days. Myocytes were isolated from basal subendocardial (endo), basal midmyocardial (mid), and apical subepicardial (epi) regions of the left ventricular free wall. Action potentials were stimulated with patch pipettes at 37 degrees C. The ratio of heart weight to body weight and mean cell capacitance are increased by 22% and 18%, respectively, in hypertrophy compared with controls (P<.001). Normal regional differences in action potential duration at 25% repolarization (APD25) are reduced in hypertrophy (control: endo, 11.4+/-0.9 ms; mid, 8.2+/-0.9 ms; epi, 5.1+/-0.4 ms; hypertrophy: endo, 11.6+/-0.9 ms; mid, 10.4+/-0.8 ms; epi, 7.8+/-0.6 ms). The regional differences in APD25 are still present in 3 mmol/L 4-aminopyridine. Hypertrophy affects APD75 differently, depending on the region of origin of myocytes (ANOVA P<.05). APD75 is shortened in subendocardial myocytes but is prolonged in subepicardial myocytes (control: endo, 126+/-7 ms; epi, 96+/-10 ms; hypertrophy: endo, 91+/-6 ms; epi, 108+/-7 ms). These changes in APD75 are altered by intracellular calcium buffering.\nQuestion: Effects of hypertrophy on regional action potential characteristics in the rat left ventricle: a cellular basis for T-wave inversion?", "gt": "Normal regional differences in APD and the changes observed in hypertrophy are only partially explained by differences in I(tol). In hypertrophy, the normal endocardial/epicardial gradient in APD75 appears to be reversed. This may explain the T-wave inversion observed and will have implications for arrhythmogenesis.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "The study examines the effects of hypertrophy on regional action potential characteristics in the left ventricle of the rat heart, providing a cellular basis for T-wave inversion observed in ECGs. Specifically, it investigates how hypertrophy affects the regional differences in action potential duration (APD), which are crucial for normal ventricular repolarization. The findings suggest that hypertrophy reduces the normal regional differences in APD, particularly at 25% repolarization (APD25), and alters APD at 75% repolarization (APD75) differently depending on the region of the myocardium. In subendocardial myocytes, APD75 is shortened, while in subepicardial myocytes, it is prolonged. These changes in APD, which are influenced by intracellular calcium buffering, indicate an abnormal sequence of ventricular repolarization that could contribute to T-wave changes seen on ECGs in hypertrophy.

Patients with rectal cancer who had a cCR to neoadjuvant chemoradiation were divided into two groups: Group A (n=23) did not undergo surgery, and Group B (n=10) underwent elective surgery. The recurrence patterns and survival outcomes were compared between the two groups. After a median follow-up of 72 months (range 12-180), seven patients (30%) in Group A developed an isolated local recurrence. In Group B, after a median follow-up of 37 months (range 12-180) there were no local recurrences.

The study highlights that among patients who achieved a cCR, those who did not undergo surgery (Group A) had a 30% rate of isolated local recurrence after a median follow-up of 72 months. This suggests that a significant portion of patients who avoid surgery after achieving a cCR may face the risk of local recurrence.\n\nIn contrast, patients who underwent elective surgery after achieving a cCR (Group B) did not experience any local recurrences during the follow-up period. However, the median follow-up time for Group B was shorter at 37 months compared to Group A, which might affect the comparability of the long-term outcomes.\n\nTherefore, while neoadjuvant chemoradiation can lead to a cCR in rectal cancer patients, the decision to avoid surgery should be carefully considered due to the risk of local recurrence. Long-term surveillance and individualized treatment planning are crucial for managing patients who achieve a cCR without immediate surgery."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Some studies suggest that epidural analgesia prolongs labor and increases the incidence of cesarean section, especially if it is administered before 5 cm cervical dilation. The purpose of the current study was to determine whether early administration of epidural analgesia affects obstetric outcome in nulliparous women who are in spontaneous labor. Informed consent was obtained from 344 healthy nulliparous women with a singleton fetus in a vertex presentation, who requested epidural analgesia during spontaneous labor at at least 36 weeks' gestation. Each patient was randomized to receive either early or late epidural analgesia. Randomization occurred only after the following conditions were met: (1) the patient requested pain relief at that moment, (2) a lumbar epidural catheter had been placed, and (3) the cervix was at least 3 cm but less than 5 cm dilated. Patients in the early group immediately received epidural bupivacaine analgesia. Patients in the late group received 10 mg nalbuphine intravenously. Late-group patients did not receive epidural analgesia until they achieved a cervical dilation of at least 5 cm or until at least 1 h had elapsed after a second dose of nalbuphine. Ten of the 344 patients were excluded because of a protocol violation or voluntary withdrawal from the study. Early administration of epidural analgesia did not increase the incidence of oxytocin augmentation, prolong the interval between randomization and the diagnosis of complete cervical dilation, or increase the incidence of malposition of the vertex at delivery. Also, early administration of epidural analgesia did not result in an increased incidence of cesarean section or instrumental vaginal delivery. Seventeen (10%) of 172 women in the early group and 13 (8%) of 162 women in the late group underwent cesarean section (relative risk for the early group 1.22; 95% confidence interval 0.62-2.40).

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) remains a significant cause of death in newborns and, despite improved outcomes with multimodality therapies, optimal timing of repair remains undefined. We sought to evaluate the influence of surgical timing on patient outcomes and hypothesized that delayed repair does not improve survival in CDH. Prospectively collected data from 1,385 CDH Registry infants without preoperative extracorporeal membrane oxygen therapy (ECMO) were evaluated. Patients were stratified by timing of repair: Day of life (DOL) 0-3 (group 1), 4-7 (group 2), or>8 (group 3), and the effect of surgical timing on mortality was determined by logistic regression and risk-adjusted for severity of illness. The unadjusted odds ratio (OR) for mortality increased significantly with delayed repair (group 2, 1.73 [95% CI, 1.00-2.98; group 3, 3.42 [95% CI, 1.97-5.96]). However, when adjusted for severity of illness, delay in repair did not predict increased mortality (group 2, 1.2 [95% CI, 0.7-2.2]; group 3, 1.4 [95% CI, 0.8-2.6]), nor did it portend an increased need for postoperative ECMO (group 2, 1.1 [95% CI, 0.5-2.4]; group 3, 0.5 [95% CI, 0.2-1.4]).\nQuestion: A risk-stratified analysis of delayed congenital diaphragmatic hernia repair: does timing of operation matter?", "gt": "After adjustment for known risk factors, the timing of CDH repair in low-risk infants does not seem to influence mortality.

Pretreatment was defined as OAD use at least 3months prior to T2DM diagnosis. Time-to-insulin initiation and healthcare costs were compared by OAD pretreatment status. Of the 866,605 patients studied, 241,856 (27.9%) were pretreated prior to T2DM diagnosis. Mean follow-up was 2.9years for pretreatment and 3.1years for those without pretreatment. Monthly diabetes-related pharmacy costs were significantly higher among pretreated patients ($66 versus $36, p<0.0001), as were overall monthly pharmacy costs ($255 versus $198, p<0.0001).

These data come from the Second Collaborative Injection Drug Users Study, a prospective cohort study that recruited injection drug users from five U.S. cities between 1997 and 1999. We used conditional logistic regression to determine the effect of bleach disinfection of syringes on anti-HCV seroconversion. Participants who reported using bleach all the time had an odds ratio (OR) for anti-HCV seroconversion of 0.35 (95% confidence interval = 0.08-1.62), whereas those reporting bleach use only some of the time had an odds ratio of 0.76 (0.21-2.70), when compared with those reporting no bleach use.\nQuestion: Does bleach disinfection of syringes protect against hepatitis C infection among young adult injection drug users?", "gt": "These results suggest that bleach disinfection of syringes, although not a substitute for use of sterile needles or cessation of injection, may help to prevent HCV infection among injection drug users.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the provided context, the use of bleach to disinfect syringes appears to have a potentially protective effect against anti-HCV seroconversion (hepatitis C infection) among injection drug users, though the evidence is not overwhelmingly strong. The analysis shows that participants who reported using bleach all the time had an odds ratio (OR) for anti-HCV seroconversion of 0.35, with a 95% confidence interval of 0.08-1.62. This suggests that while there is a trend towards protection, the wide confidence interval that includes 1 indicates that the result is not statistically significant. Similarly, for those who reported using bleach some of the time, the odds ratio was 0.76, with a confidence interval of 0.21-2.70, which also includes 1, indicating no significant protective effect. Therefore, while there is a suggestion that bleach disinfection could reduce the risk of hepatitis C infection, the data does not provide conclusive evidence of a protective effect among young adult injection drug users."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Since 2011, all acute general surgical admissions have been managed by the consultant-led emergency general surgery service (EGS) at our institution. We aim to compare EGS management of acute biliary disease to its preceding model. Retrospective review of prospectively collated databases was performed to capture consecutive emergency admissions with biliary disease from 1st February 2009 to 31st January 2013. Patient demographics, surgical intervention, use of diagnostic radiology, histological diagnosis, complications and hospital length of stay (LOS) were retrieved. A total of 566 patients were included (pre-EGS 254 vs. EGS 312). In the EGS period, the number of patients having surgery on index admission increased from 43.7 to 58.7 % (p<0.001) as did use of intra-operative cholangiography from 75.7 to 89.6 % (p = 0.003). The conversion to open cholecystectomy rate also was reduced from 14.4 to 3.3 % (p<0.001). Overall, a 14 % reduction in use of multiple (>1) imaging modalities for diagnosis was noted (p = 0.003). There was a positive trend in reduction of bile leaks but no significant difference in the overall morbidity and mortality. Time to theatre was reduced by 1 day [pre-EGS 2.7 (IQR 1.5-5.0) vs. EGS 1.7 (IQR 1.2-2.6) p<0.001]. The overall hospital LOS was reduced by 1.5 days [pre-EGS 5.0 (IQR 3-7) vs. EGS 3.5 (IQR 2-5) p<0.001].\nQuestion: Emergency Management of Gallbladder Disease: Are Acute Surgical Units the New Gold Standard?", "gt": "Since the advent of EGS, more judicious use of diagnostic radiology, reduced complications, reduced LOS, reduced time to theatre and an increased rate of definitive management during the index admission were demonstrated.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "The study you've provided offers insights into the effectiveness of an Emergency General Surgery (EGS) service in the management of acute biliary disease, compared to a previous model. Based on the findings, several points suggest that acute surgical units might be moving towards becoming the gold standard for emergency management of gallbladder disease:\n\n1. **Surgical Interventions**: The rate of surgical interventions on the initial admission increased significantly in the EGS period (from 43.7% to 58.7%), indicating that the EGS model is more proactive in addressing acute biliary disease through surgical means.\n\n2. **Diagnostic Efficiency**: There was a reduction in the use of multiple imaging modalities for diagnosis, suggesting that the EGS approach is more efficient in diagnostic processes, likely due to streamlined protocols and expertise.\n\n3. **Procedure Safety and Efficacy**: The rate of conversion to open cholecystectomy was notably reduced in the EGS period, which could indicate improved laparoscopic surgical skills and possibly better patient outcomes due to less invasive procedures.\n\n4. **Operative Techniques**: The increased use of intra-operative cholangiography (from 75.7% to 89.6%) in the EGS period suggests enhanced intraoperative assessment and decision-making capabilities, which can lead to better surgical outcomes.\n\n5. **Time to Treatment**: The time to surgery was significantly reduced in the EGS period, which is crucial in acute conditions where timely intervention can significantly affect patient outcomes.\n\n6. **Hospital Stay**: There was a reduction in overall hospital length of stay (LOS) by 1.5 days, which not only benefits the patient in terms of recovery but also has implications for hospital resource management and cost-efficiency.\n\nWhile there was no significant difference noted in the overall morbidity and mortality rates between the two periods, the improvements in surgical and diagnostic efficiency, as well as the reduction in LOS and time to treatment, strongly suggest that the EGS model could indeed be considered the new gold standard in the emergency management of gallbladder disease. However, it is important to note that the gold standard may vary depending on local resources, expertise, and specific patient populations. Further research and validation across different settings would help solidify the position of acute surgical units as the preferred model for managing acute biliary disease."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: The lean phenotype of cystathionine beta-synthase-deficient homocystinuria and the positive association of plasma total cysteine (tCys) with body mass index (BMI) suggest that total homocysteine (tHcy) and tCys are associated with body composition. We aimed to study associations of tCys and tHcy with body composition in the general population. Using data from 7038 Hordaland Homocysteine Study participants, we fitted regression models and dose-response curves of tCys and tHcy with BMI. In 5179 participants, we investigated associations of tCys and tHcy with fat mass and lean mass and examined whether changes in these aminothiols predicted body composition 6 y later. tCys showed positive associations with BMI (partial r = 0.28, P<0.001), and fat mass (partial r = 0.25, P<0.001), independent of diet, exercise, and plasma lipids. Women in the highest tCys quintile had fat mass 9 kg (95% CI: 8, 10 kg; P<0.001) greater than that of women in the lowest quintile. The corresponding values for men were 6 kg (95% CI: 5, 7 kg; P<0.001; P<0.001 in both sexes, ANOVA across quintiles). The rise in tCys over 6 y was associated with greater fat mass at follow-up (P<0.001), but there was no effect on lean mass. tHcy was not associated with lean mass, and it became significantly inversely associated with BMI and fat mass only after adjustment for tCys. The association between tHcy and lean mass was not significant.\nQuestion: Homocysteine, cysteine, and body composition in the Hordaland Homocysteine Study: does cysteine link amino acid and lipid metabolism?", "gt": "tCys concentrations show a strong positive association with BMI, mediated through fat mass.

However, the effect of CRPs on other physiological/quality-of-life outcomes and effect of time from stroke on these results has not been investigated. The objectives of the present study are (1) to evaluate the effects of a CRP in participants with motor impairment after stroke and (2) to explore the effects of elapsed time from stroke on physiological/quality-of-life outcomes. The CRP included 24 weeks of resistance and aerobic training. Primary outcomes in 120 participants, 25.4\u00b142.3 (mean\u00b1standard deviation) months after stroke, included 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), VO2peak, timed repeated sit-to-stand performance, and affected-side isometric knee extensor strength (IKES). Secondary measures included gait characteristics (cadence, step lengths, and symmetry), walking speed, balance (Berg Balance Scale), affected-side range of motion (ROM), elbow flexor and grip strength, anaerobic threshold, and perceptions of participation/social reintegration. After adjusting for multiple comparisons, participants demonstrated significant improvements (all P<.001) in 6MWD (283.2\u00b1126.6 to 320.7\u00b1141.8 m), sit-to-stand performance (16.3\u00b19.5 to 13.3\u00b17.1 seconds), affected-side IKES (25.9\u00b110.1 to 30.2\u00b111 kg as a percentage of body mass), and VO2peak (15.2\u00b14.5 to 17.2\u00b14.9 mL\u00b7kg\u00b7min(-1)). Participants also demonstrated post-CRP improvements in secondary outcomes: anaerobic threshold, balance, affected-side hip/shoulder ROM, grip and isometric elbow flexor strength, participation, walking speed, cadence (all P<.001), and bilateral step lengths (P<.04).

This suggests that participants who had a stroke more recently (shorter time since stroke) showed greater improvements in their 6MWD compared to those with a longer time since their stroke. This finding implies that the time elapsed since the stroke does indeed make a difference in the outcomes of the CRP, with more recent stroke survivors potentially benefiting more from the program in terms of walking distance.\n\nIn conclusion, the study indicates that an adapted CRP can significantly improve multiple physiological and quality-of-life outcomes in individuals with motor impairment after a stroke. However, the effectiveness of the program in terms of improving 6MWD may diminish as the time since the stroke increases."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Sixteen patients with 19 renal artery stents underwent CT angiography. A biphasic protocol was performed including arteriographic acquisition at standard 120 kVp and a late-arterial scan at 100 kVp (n=9) or 80 kVp (n=7). Images were reconstructed under various algorithms. Signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios (SNR, CNR) were determined within stent, aorta and renal arteries. Image quality and the presence of restenosis were assessed. Volume CT dose-index was recorded and dose reduction (DR%) between phases was calculated. Ten patients presented with Hounsfield values>250 HU in all segments, phases and reconstructions and were further evaluated. The 120 kVp protocol performed better in all vessels and reconstruction algorithms. SNR at 120 kVp (B31f) did not differ significantly compared to 100 kVp (B31f). CNR within stent was borderline compromised at 100 kVp (p=0.042). All but two image sets (at 80 kVp) were considered diagnostic. Minor loss of subjective image quality was noticed at 100 kVp. No difference in assessment of restenosis was observed between 120 kVp and the diagnostic low-exposure scans. Mean DR% was estimated 45% at 100 kVp and 77% at 80 kVp.\nQuestion: MDCT angiography assessment of renal artery in-stent restenosis: can we reduce the radiation exposure burden?", "gt": "Renal MDCT angiography and stent-restenosis assessment are feasible at 100 kVp with minor loss of image quality and almost half radiation exposure.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the provided context, it is possible to reduce the radiation exposure burden during MDCT (Multi-Detector Computed Tomography) angiography assessment of renal artery in-stent restenosis.

The 120 kVp protocol performed better across all vessels and reconstruction algorithms, but the SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) at 120 kVp did not differ significantly from that at 100 kVp for all reconstructions.\n2. CNR (Contrast-to-Noise Ratio) within the stent was only borderline compromised at 100 kVp, suggesting that there is minimal loss in image quality.\n3. All but two image sets (at 80 kVp) were considered diagnostic, indicating that lower kVp settings can still produce clinically acceptable images.\n4. No difference was observed in the assessment of restenosis between the 120 kVp protocol and the diagnostic low-exposure scans at 100 kVp and 80 kVp.\n5. The mean dose reduction (DR%) was 45% at 100 kVp and 77% at 80 kVp, which represents a substantial reduction in radiation exposure.\n\nTherefore, while there may be a minor loss in subjective image quality when using lower kVp settings, the clinical value and diagnostic capability of the scans remain intact, thus allowing for a reduction in the radiation exposure burden."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Elastic nailing is a common method of fixation for tibial shaft fractures in skeletally immature individuals. Poor outcomes of titanium elastic nails for femoral shaft fractures have been associated with increasing patient age and weight, especially patients weighing>50 kg.

This is a retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent stabilization of a tibial shaft fracture with titanium elastic nails at a large tertiary-care pediatric trauma center. Data collected included patient demographics, injury characteristics, and radiographic data. Weight groups were stratified as \u2265 or<50 kg, and age groups as 14 years or older or less than 14 years old. Malunion was defined as 10 degrees of angulation in either the sagittal or coronal plane. Union was defined as bridging of \u22653 cortices on orthogonal radiographs. A significant difference in time to union was considered to be 3 weeks. Ninety-five patients were included with a mean age of 12.1 years (range, 6 to 16 y) and a mean weight of 50.2 kg (range, 21 to 122 kg). Malunion rate was similar between weight cohorts: 13.3% (6/45) in the \u226550-kg group and 10% (5/50) in the<50-kg group (P=0.61). Malunion rate was similarly comparable between age groups: 17.6% (6/34) in the 14 years and older group and 8.2% (5/61) in the less than 14-year-old group (P=0.17).

The purpose of this study was to discern the effective treatment methods of fistula-in-ano in infants. A retrospective review was done of 310 children who required operative management for fistula-in-ano or perianal abscess between January 1991 and July 2000. Eighteen patients displayed an onset of symptoms at less than 1 year of age and a duration of symptoms longer than 12 months. The authors analyzed these patients' medical records. All patients were boys. The mean duration of the symptoms was 26.6 +/- 27.5 months. Fourteen patients had shown an onset of symptoms at less than 6 months of age. The longest duration was 10 years. The patients showed conservative periods of over 12 months because their parents did not want them to undergo surgery. The disease in these patients followed 2 patterns. One (6 patients) was an onset of symptoms followed by a silent fistula-in-ano state. The other (12 patients) was an onset of symptoms followed by an intermittent relapse of inflammation. All patients underwent fistulotomy, and none of them had recurrent fistula during the follow-up period.\nQuestion: Fistula-in-ano in infants: is nonoperative management effective?", "gt": "Although the advantages of a nonoperative management of fistula-in-ano in infants include the avoidance of general anesthesia and surgical intervention, the lesions cannot be cured by a period of conservation.

To retrospectively estimate the sensitivity and especially the specificity of breast MRI in the non-screening setting as an adjunct to mammography sorted by breast density and to estimate the accuracy of breast MRI in cases rated BI-RADS 0 and 3 mammographically. A total of 216 consecutive patients with referral to breast MRI and previously acquired mammography were enrolled in this analysis. Negative findings were followed up with a mean time of 26.7 months. The loss to follow-up was 10.8%. The single breast was regarded as the study subject (n=399, 364 cases were eligible for calculation of diagnostic accuracy). BI-RADS 1 and 2 were rated as benign, 4 and 5 as malignant. BI-RADS 0 and 3 were analyzed separately. The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated from the normally approximated binomial distribution and taken to represent significant differences for the two imaging modalities if they did not overlap. Among the study population, 62 malignant neoplasms were detected. For cases rated BI-RADS 1, 2, 4, and 5 (n=251), the sensitivity of breast MRI was 95.7% (95% CI 89.9-100.0%) and 74.5% (95% CI 62.0-87.0%) for mammography, respectively. The specificity of breast MRI was 96.1% (95% CI 93.4-98.8%) and 92.2% (95% CI 88.5-95.9%) for mammography, respectively. The diagnostic accuracy of breast MRI did not depend on breast density. In cases rated BI-RADS 0, n=57 (3, n=56), breast MRI achieved a sensitivity of 100% (90.9%) and a specificity of 98.1% (88.9%).

This indicates that breast MRI is effective in identifying non-malignant cases, with a low rate of false positives. The specificity of mammography, in comparison, was lower at 92.2% (95% CI 88.5-95.9%). \n\nMoreover, the study found that the diagnostic accuracy of breast MRI did not depend on breast density, which is an important consideration since breast density can affect the performance of mammography, leading to lower specificity in dense breasts.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: To determine the proportion of patients who received a blood transfusion after joint replacement, and to devise a simple method to ensure patients were transfused based on strict clinical and haematological need. Prospective audit over 2 years. The study group was 151 patients who underwent total hip and knee arthroplasty in a typical district general hospital (Kettering) over a 2-year period. They were divided into three consecutive groups. Current practice was audited (producing the first group of 62 patients) and transfusion rates were compared to regional figures. Local guidelines were drawn up. A form was introduced on which the indications for any transfusion had to be documented prior to transfusion of the blood. This was designed to encourage transfusion only on strong clinical grounds or an haemoglobin (Hb) level<8 g/dl. Transfusion practice was then re-audited (producing the second group of 44 patients) to assess whether practice had improved. A year later, all relevant staff were reminded by letter of the guidelines. The process was then re-audited (producing the third group of 45 patients) again to determine whether practice remained improved or not. In the first audit (current practice) of 62 patients, the overall transfusion rate was 71%, with a higher rate in the hip replacement group (84%) ordered mainly by anaesthetic staff. Ward staff were reluctant not to transfuse patients whose Hb level fell below 10 g/dl.

This high rate may indicate that transfusions were being performed more frequently than strictly necessary based on clinical and hematological criteria.\n\nHowever, after introducing local guidelines and a form requiring documentation of indications for transfusions, the transfusion rate significantly decreased to 37% in the second audit. This reduction suggests that the initial high rates were likely due to practices that could be considered overuse.

At 1, 3 and 7 days animals were tested according to a neurological deficit score (NDS). After 7 days of reperfusion, coronal brain sections were analysed by Nissl- and TUNEL-staining. Viable as well as TUNEL-positive neurons were counted in the hippocampal CA-1 sector. For statistical analysis, the log rank and the Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA test were used. All data are given as mean+/-S.D.; a p-value<0.05 was considered significant. Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) measured in the aorta did not differ between the vasopressor groups, whereas placebo animals had significantly lower levels. Survival to 7 days revealed significant differences between the placebo (n = 0/8) and all vasopressor groups (adrenaline, 10/15; adrenaline/vasopressin, 8/15; vasopressin, 12/15). Histological deficit scoring by quantitative analysis of the Nissl- and TUNEL-staining showed no difference in the amount of viable and apoptotic neurons in the vasopressin group (viable: 33+/-18; apoptotic: 63+/-23) versus the adrenaline group (viable: 21+/-12; apoptotic: 67+/-17) and the adrenaline/vasopressin group (viable: 31+/-26; apoptotic: 61+/-27). Neurological deficit scoring did not show any differences between the vasopressor groups.\nQuestion: Vasopressors are essential during cardiopulmonary resuscitation in rats: Is vasopressin superior to adrenaline?", "gt": "Administration of arginine-vasopressin during CPR does not improve behavioural and cerebral histopathological outcome, compared to the use of adrenaline or the combination of both vasopressors, after cardiac arrest in rats.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the context provided, vasopressin does not appear to be superior to adrenaline in terms of neurological recovery and survival rates in a rat model of cardiac arrest and subsequent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).

However, there were no significant differences in the amount of viable and apoptotic neurons in the hippocampal CA-1 sector, as well as in neurological deficit scoring, between the vasopressin group and the adrenaline group, or the combined group. Therefore, the data does not support the conclusion that vasopressin is superior to adrenaline in this specific context."}

Four gastric biopsies from each patient were fixed in 10% buffered formalin for histopathologic analysis, and one was frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and used for genotyping. CagA and vacA genotypes were determined by multiplex polymerase chain reaction and reverse hybridization on a line probe assay.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: There is increased risk for the occurrence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and renovascular thrombosis after kidney transplantation. A disruption of the blood homeostasis caused by surgery and leading to clotting and bleeding malfunctions is widely accepted. However, other causes such as inherited or acquired disorders of the clotting system may further increase the risk of thrombosis. Here, we summarize and review data on possible causes, incidence and ways to prevent the occurrence of DVT and/or renovascular thrombosis after kidney transplantation. The incidence of DVT after kidney transplantation is 6.2-8.3% and approximately 25% of these patients suffer from pulmonary embolism. The DVT occurs primarily on the side of the transplant with an increased risk throughout the first 5 months after transplantation. Thereby, 2-12% of the patients develop renovascular thromboses, most of which are related directly to the surgery. However, inherited or acquired thrombophilia may also play an important role. A severe course is known for prothrombin gene G20210A polymorphism, which can result in graft loss. A great diversity of prophylactic treatments is available but adjustment to the underlying circumstances is crucial for a favourable outcome. Low-dose heparin prophylaxis for at least 2-3 weeks can be used as standard therapy to prevent the occurrence of DVT after kidney transplantation. However, this may not be sufficient for concurrent disorders of the blood homeostasis such as elevated levels of antiphospholipid antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, prothrombin gene G20210A polymorphism or a combined inherited thrombophilia. These patients may need a prophylactic anticoagulation with coumarins starting prior to transplantation and being continued for at least 1 year or even lifelong. Only randomized trials can answer the question concerning optimal duration and safety of coumarins in this setting.\nQuestion: Do we need screening for thrombophilia prior to kidney transplantation?", "gt": "DVT and/or renovascular thromboses are severe complications after kidney transplantation. Inherited and acquired thrombophilia, apart from surgery and abnormal anatomy itself, have to be considered and proper prophylactic treatment initiated.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the context provided, screening for thrombophilia prior to kidney transplantation appears to be advisable. The text highlights that inherited or acquired disorders of the clotting system, such as thrombophilia, can significantly increase the risk of thrombosis after kidney transplantation. Specific conditions like the prothrombin gene G20210A polymorphism, elevated levels of antiphospholipid antibodies, and the presence of lupus anticoagulant are mentioned as factors that may necessitate more intensive prophylactic measures, including the use of anticoagulants like coumarins before and after the transplantation. Given that these conditions can lead to a severe course and potentially result in graft loss, screening could help identify patients who need more aggressive prophylactic treatments to prevent thrombosis. Therefore, screening for thrombophilia before kidney transplantation could be crucial for tailoring the appropriate prophylactic strategy to each patient's specific risk profile."}

For this retrospective study, we included consecutive subjects who underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Resting V\u0307o2 was determined using breath-by-breath testing methodology. Using a training cohort (n = 336), we developed 3 models to predict V\u0307o2. In a validation group (n = 114), we compared our models with 7 available formulae. Our first model (V\u0307o2 = -184.99 + 189.64 \u00d7 body surface area [BSA, m(2)] + 1.49 \u00d7 heart rate [beats/min]+ 51.51 \u00d7 FIO2 [21% = 0; 30% = 1] + 30.62 \u00d7 gender [male = 1; female = 0]) showed an R(2) of 0.5.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: The authors determined the usefulness of frozen section (FS) evaluation in the operative management of follicular lesions of the thyroid. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cannot reliably discriminate between benign and malignant follicular lesions of the thyroid. Accordingly, FS evaluation is used routinely to guide intraoperative management. One hundred twenty-five consecutive patients with follicular thyroid lesions who underwent surgical exploration at the Johns Hopkins Hospital were reviewed. Frozen sections were categorized in 104 of 120 patients (87%) as \"follicular lesion, defer to permanent section,\" rendering no useful clinical information. In only 4 of 120 patients (3.3%) did FS evaluation correctly modify the operative procedure.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: The discrepancy between high rates of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for intraductal ultrasonography (IDUS) in extrahepatic bile duct carcinoma and the failure to depict different wall layers as defined by the TNM classification have not yet been elucidated sufficiently. In a prospective study, endosonographic images were correlated with histomorphology including immunohistochemistry. Using IDUS, we examined fresh resection specimens of patients who had undergone pancreato-duodenectomy. For histological analysis, the formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded specimens were stained by hematoxylin-eosin, elastica-van-Gieson, and immunohistochemically by smooth muscle-actin. To confirm our hypothesis, further cases from the archives were analyzed histopathologically and immunohistochemically. The various wall layers of the extrahepatic bile duct as described by the International Union Against Cancer are neither histomorphologically nor immunohistochemically consistently demonstrable. Especially, a clear differentiation between tumor invasion beyond the wall of the bile duct (T2) and invasion of the pancreas (T3) by histopathological means is often not possible. Endosonographic images using high-resolution miniprobes similarly confirm the difficulty in imaging various layers in the bile duct wall.\nQuestion: Endosonographic and histopathological staging of extrahepatic bile duct cancer: time to leave the present TNM-classification?", "gt": "Most adaptations made by the sixth edition of the TNM classification accommodate to the endosonographic and most of the histopathological findings as demonstrated in our study.

The TNM classification system, which stands for Tumor, Node, and Metastasis, is a standard way to describe the extent of cancer for various types of tumors, including extrahepatic bile duct carcinoma. However, the study indicates that the layers of the bile duct wall, as defined by this classification, are not consistently identifiable either through high-resolution intraductal ultrasonography (IDUS) or through histological and immunohistochemical analysis of resected specimens.\n\nThe difficulty in clearly differentiating between tumor invasion beyond the wall of the bile duct (T2) and invasion into the pancreas (T3) is highlighted as a particular challenge. This suggests that the current TNM classification might not accurately reflect the biological behavior and extent of the tumor in extrahepatic bile duct cancer as assessed by these methods.\n\nGiven these findings, the question of whether it is time to reconsider or modify the present TNM classification for extrahepatic bile duct cancer is valid. The limitations in both imaging and histopathological staging could imply that the current classification system may not fully capture the complexity and variability of tumor invasion patterns in these cancers. Therefore, a revision of the TNM classification to better align with the diagnostic capabilities of modern imaging techniques and histopathological methods might be necessary to improve the accuracy of staging and, consequently, the management and prognosis of patients with extrahepatic bile duct cancer."}

The cut-off value for water iodine concentrations considered to be indicative of environmental iodine deficiency is<2 \u00b5g L(-1) . The mean iodine concentration of water from 18 Gippsland water treatment plants was 0.38 \u00b5g L(-1) and would therefore make negligible difference to the dietary intake of iodine.

This was an exploratory, cross-sectional study conducted using a convenience sample of 104 Year\u00a03 dental students completing 20 MCQs on implant dentistry. Students were asked to select the most correct response and to indicate their confidence in it for each question. Identifying both correctness and confidence allowed the designation of uninformed (incorrect and not confident) or misinformed (incorrect but confident) responses. In addition to recording correct/incorrect responses and student confidence, faculty staff designated incorrect responses as benign, inappropriate or potentially harmful if applied to clinical care. Question type was identified as factual or complex. Logistic regression was used to evaluate relationships between student confidence, and question type and gender. Students were misinformed more often than uninformed (22% versus 8%), and misinformed responses were more common with complex than factual questions (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

In decision analytic terms if the loss in health when seminal vesicles are invaded and not completely removed is considered at least 75 times greater than when removing them unnecessarily, the algorithm proposed by the European Society of Urological Oncology should not be used.\nQuestion: Is it necessary to remove the seminal vesicles completely at radical prostatectomy?", "gt": "Whether to use the European Society of Urological Oncology algorithm depends not only on its accuracy, but also on the relative clinical consequences of false-positive and false-negative results. Our threshold of 75 is an intermediate value that is difficult to interpret, given uncertainties about the benefit of seminal vesicle sparing and harm associated with untreated seminal vesicle invasion. We recommend more formal decision analysis to determine the clinical value of the European Society of Urological Oncology algorithm.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the context provided, the necessity of removing the seminal vesicles during a radical prostatectomy is conditional and depends on several factors. The European Society of Urological Oncology suggests that the removal of seminal vesicles may not be necessary for patients with a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level less than 10 ng/ml, unless the biopsy Gleason score is greater than 6 or more than 50% of the biopsy cores are positive. \n\nThe analysis of the data set indicates that the algorithm proposed by the European Society of Urological Oncology has a high negative predictive value (98.6%), meaning that when the algorithm predicts no seminal vesicle invasion, it is highly likely to be correct. However, the decision to remove the seminal vesicles also hinges on the potential health implications of not removing them if they are invaded. The context suggests that if the health loss from not removing invaded seminal vesicles is considered at least 75 times greater than the loss from unnecessarily removing them, then the algorithm should not be used, implying that removal might be warranted in a broader range of cases to avoid the potentially severe consequences of missing seminal vesicle invasion.\n\nTherefore, while the algorithm provides a guideline, the necessity of complete removal of the seminal vesicles should be carefully considered in the context of the patient's specific risk factors and the potential health consequences of seminal vesicle invasion."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection can recur even after eradication by triple therapy. We hypothesize that maintenance acid suppression treatment after standard eradication therapy would be necessary to further reduce ulcer recurrence in Jordanian population. This is a retrospective study that was conducted at King Abdullah University Hospital (KAUH), a major University hospital, and tertiary care facility (>400 beds) located in North Jordan. Endoscopic and histologic results and medication history were reviewed for each patient who has prescribed eradication therapy for HP over the period from July 2003 until May 2006. Maintenance acid suppression treatment after standard eradication therapy markedly reduced the recurrence rate of peptic ulcer from 58.3% (with out maintenance acid suppression treatment) to 1.45% (with maintenance acid suppression treatment).\nQuestion: Is maintenance acid suppression necessary to reduce the rate of reinfection with Helicobacter pylori?", "gt": "Our results indicate that treatment of HP infection by eradication regimen (triple therapy only) is not enough to prevent recurrence of ulcer in the Jordanian population. Thus, we recommend maintenance acid suppression following standard H. pylori eradication regimen to maintain remission.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "The provided context does not directly address the necessity of maintenance acid suppression in reducing the rate of reinfection with Helicobacter pylori (HP).

The data presented is more relevant to the management of peptic ulcer disease as a consequence of HP eradication rather than the prevention of HP reinfection itself. To determine the necessity of maintenance acid suppression for preventing HP reinfection, one would need data specifically addressing HP reinfection rates with and without maintenance acid suppression."}

We also assessed the postoperative complications after removal of the partially impacted 3M. A split mouth, randomized clinical study was designed. The study sample included patients with bilateral partially impacted 3Ms. The primary predictor variable was the type of flap design (flaps 1 and 2). The primary outcome variable was periodontal status (gingival recession [GR], probing depth [PD], plaque index [PI], and gingival index) of the 2Ms measured preoperatively and 90 days postoperatively. The secondary outcome variables were postoperative complications, including pain, facial swelling, alveolitis, and local wound infection. The other variables included gender, position of the 3Ms, and surgical difficulty. We performed descriptive, comparative, correlation, and multivariate analyses. The sample included 28 patients aged 18 to 28 years. The GR, PD, and PI values with the flap 2 design were greater than those with the flap 1 design (P<.05). Facial swelling with the flap 1 design was significantly greater than with the flap 2 design on the second postoperative day (P<.05). The pain levels with the flap 1 design were significantly greater than those with the flap 2 design on the first and second postoperative days (P<.05). According to the multivariate regression analyses, flap design was closely related to the periodontal status of the 2Ms and postoperative discomfort.\nQuestion: Does laterally rotated flap design influence the short-term periodontal status of second molars and postoperative discomfort after partially impacted third molar surgery?", "gt": "The results of the present clinical study have shown that the flap design in partially impacted 3M surgery considerably influences the early periodontal health of the 2Ms and postoperative discomfort.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: There is a lack of evidence regarding the role of drainage in laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) for acutely inflamed gallbladder (AIGB), and drain insertion remains controversial. From December 2013 to November 2014, a total of 193 patients who needed LC due to AIGB at the four participating hospitals were entered in this study. After the operation, the patients were randomly assigned to undergo drain insertion (94 patients, 48.7%, group A) or not (99 patients, 51.3%, group B). The surgical outcomes between the two groups were prospectively reviewed. The study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov at the inception of enrollment (NCT02027402). Both groups were comparable in terms of patient demographics, operative time and postoperative hospital stay. In 18 cases (9.3%), postoperative morbidities such as bleeding, bile leakage, wound infection or an abscess occurred, and there was no significant difference between the two groups. The visual analog scale pain score measured at 24 h (3.9\u2009\u00b1\u20091.4 in group A and 3.3\u2009\u00b1\u20092.0 in group B, P\u2009=\u20090.014) and 48 h (2.1\u2009\u00b1\u20091.5 in group A and 1.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.4 in group B, P\u2009=\u20090.006) was significantly higher in group A.\nQuestion: Is routine drain insertion after laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis beneficial?", "gt": "Routine drain insertion does not prevent or reduce postoperative morbidities after LC for AIGB and can even cause prolonged postoperative pain.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: The actual gold standard of Botulin A toxin (BoTx A) batches qualification is the mouse lethality assay. With this assay it is nevertheless impossible to set a therapeutic value unit. The goal of this research was to study the effects of BoTx A increasing concentrations on glutamatergic rat neurons. We studied the glutamate release with increasing concentrations of BoTx A. We also studied the BoTx A target cleavage with a western blot technique. Our results proved that it is possible to establish a dose-response - like curve of BoTx A effects on glutamate release. Moreover the cleavage of the target protein was visible for the same toxin concentrations that inhibited the glutamate release.\nQuestion: Measurement of botulinum toxin activity: towards a new cellular culture assay?", "gt": "This technique could be the first step toward a new way of setting a better pharmaceutical profile for toxin batches.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the provided context, it appears that the research aims to develop a new method for measuring botulinum toxin A (BoTx A) activity through a cellular culture assay rather than relying on the traditional mouse lethality assay.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: While a considerable body of research has explored the relationship between patient expectations and clinical outcomes, few studies investigate the extent to which patient expectations change over time. Further, the temporal relationship between expectations and symptoms is not well researched. We conducted a latent class growth analysis on patients (n = 874) with back pain. Patients were categorised in latent profile clusters according to the course of their expectations over 3 months. Nearly 80% of participants showed a pattern of stable expectation levels, these patients had either high, medium or low levels of expectations for the whole study period. While baseline levels of symptom severity did not discriminate between the three clusters, those in the groups with higher expectations experienced better outcome at 3 months. Approximately 15% of patients showed decrease in expectation levels over the study period and the remainder were categorised in a group with increasingly positive expectations. In the former clusters, decrease in expectations appeared to be concordant with a plateau in symptom improvement, and in the latter, increase in expectations occurred alongside an increase in symptom improvement rate.\nQuestion: Do recovery expectations change over time?", "gt": "The expectations of most people presenting to primary care with low back pain do not change over the first 3 months of their condition. People with very positive, stable expectations generally experience a good outcome.

The research identified different patterns of change in patient expectations over a 3-month period among patients with back pain. While a significant portion of the patients (nearly 80%) showed stable levels of expectations, either high, medium, or low, throughout the study period, a smaller group (approximately 15%) experienced a decrease in their expectations. Additionally, there was a group whose expectations increased over time. These findings indicate that patient expectations are not static and can evolve, potentially reflecting changes in their perceived recovery trajectory or the effectiveness of the treatment they are undergoing."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Recent studies reported lower quality of care for black vs. white patients with community-acquired pneumonia and suggested that disparities persist at the individual hospital level. We examined racial differences in emergency department and intensive care unit care processes to determine whether differences persist after adjusting for case-mix and variation in care across hospitals. Prospective, observational cohort study. Twenty-eight U.S. hospitals. Patients with community-acquired pneumonia: 1738 white and 352 black patients. None. We compared care quality based on antibiotic receipt within 4 hrs and adherence to American Thoracic Society antibiotic guidelines, and intensity based on intensive care unit admission and mechanical ventilation use. Using random effects and generalized estimating equations models, we adjusted for case-mix and clustering of racial groups within hospitals and estimated odds ratios for differences in care within and across hospitals. Black patients were less likely to receive antibiotics within 4 hrs (odds ratio, 0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.43-0.70; p<.001) and less likely to receive guideline-adherent antibiotics (odds ratio, 0.72; 95% confidence interval, 0.57-0.91; p = .006). These differences were attenuated after adjusting for casemix (odds ratio, 0.59; 95% confidence interval; 0.46-0.76 and 0.84; 95% confidence interval, 0.66 -1.09). Within hospitals, black and white patients received similar care quality (odds ratio, 1; 95% confidence interval, 0.97-1.04 and 1; 95% confidence interval, 0.97-1.03). However, hospitals that served a greater proportion of black patients were less likely to provide timely antibiotics (odds ratio, 0.84; 95% confidence interval, 0.78-0.90). Black patients were more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (odds ratio, 1.57; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-2.42; p = .042). Again, within hospitals, black and white subjects were equally likely to receive mechanical ventilation (odds ratio, 1; 95% confidence interval, .94-1.06) and hospitals that served a greater proportion of black patients were more likely to institute mechanical ventilation (odds ratio, 1.13; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.25).\nQuestion: Do hospitals provide lower quality of care to black patients for pneumonia?", "gt": "Black patients appear to receive lower quality and higher intensity of care in crude analyses. However, these differences were explained by different case-mix and variation in care across hospitals. Within the same hospital, no racial differences in care were observed.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the provided context, the direct comparison of care quality between black and white patients within the same hospitals shows no significant differences in terms of receiving timely antibiotics and adherence to antibiotic guidelines after adjusting for case-mix. However, there are disparities when looking at the hospital level: hospitals that serve a greater proportion of black patients are less likely to provide timely antibiotics and are more likely to institute mechanical ventilation. This suggests that while individual-level disparities within hospitals may be mitigated, systemic issues related to the hospitals serving predominantly black populations might contribute to lower quality of care or differences in treatment intensity for black patients with community-acquired pneumonia."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Among patients with peptic ulcer disease, the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori has been reported to range from 80% to 90%. Thus empirical cost-effective therapy has been suggested. We surveyed patients with peptic ulcer disease in Rochester, NY. From two teaching hospitals all patients who had duodenal ulcers (DU) and/or gastric ulcers (GU) on esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with antral biopsy for histology for H. pylori and for rapid urease (CLO) test were included in the study. We examined a total of 160 patients with DU and 145 patients with GU, age range 18-92 yr, obtaining clinical data, race, medication profile, and history of use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). An ulcer was defined if the lesion with loss of mucosal integrity was>or = 0.5 cm, with apparent depth. H. pylori was considered present if CLO test and/or histology were positive for H. pylori. To confirm the reliability of nonuse of NSAIDs, we randomly checked blood samples of 90 such patients from the ambulatory clinic for the presence of salicylates. To identify the sensitivity of the CLO test, we performed a serology test for H. pylori antibody in 100 subjects to compare the CLO test results. Also, 500 CLO test results were compared to the histology results for H. pylori. Among 160 DU patients, 16 were NSAID users with negative H. pylori and excluded from the prevalence study. Of the remaining 144 patients with DU, H. pylori was present in 88 patients (61%). When these data were analyzed according to race, H. pylori was present in 54 (52%) of 104 whites compared to 34 of 40 (85%) nonwhites (blacks, Hispanics, Asians) (p<0.01). Among 145 GU patients 18 were NSAID users with negative H. pylori and excluded from the prevalence analysis. Of the remaining 127 patients with GU, H. pylori was present in 87 patients (61%). Among them, H. pylori was present in 46 of 87 (53%) whites, whereas 31 of 40 nonwhites (78%) were H. pylori-positive (p<0.01). Antral histology and CLO test for H. pylori were in agreement in 92% of cases. Serology and CLO test for H. pylori were in agreement in 87% of cases.

The study also showed a racial disparity, with nonwhites (blacks, Hispanics, Asians) having a higher prevalence of H. pylori compared to whites.\n\nGiven these findings, empirical triple therapy (a standard treatment for H. pylori infection involving a proton pump inhibitor and two antibiotics) could be considered cost-effective for the majority of peptic ulcer patients in this population, particularly among nonwhite patients. However, the decision to implement empirical therapy should also consider the local resistance patterns of H. pylori to antibiotics, the cost and availability of the therapy, and the potential side effects and risks of unnecessary antibiotic use.\n\nThe reliability of the H. pylori testing methods (CLO test and histology) was also confirmed in the study, with high agreement rates, which supports the accuracy of the prevalence estimates. Therefore, while empirical therapy may be justified for a significant portion of the peptic ulcer patients in this region, it would be prudent to perform H. pylori testing to confirm infection before initiating treatment, especially in patients where the likelihood of H. pylori infection is lower, such as white patients in this study."}

Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine predictors of hospital death, long-term event-free survival, and probability of repair. Patients were evaluated in three groups: all patients, patients with acute endocarditis, and patients with chronic endocarditis. There were ten hospital deaths (6.8%). Patients undergoing repair had a lower hospital mortality rate (p = 0.008) then those having replacement. Event-free survival was improved after mitral valve repair in the overall group (p = 0.02) and in the group with healed (chronic) endocarditis (p = 0.05).

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: The treatment of personality disorder is repeatedly reported as less successful than the treatment of patients without personality disorder. Most clinicians believe that anxiety disorder in tandem with a personality disorder often leads to longer treatment, worsens the prognosis, and thus increases treatment costs. Our study was designed to compare the short-term effectiveness of therapy in patients suffering from social phobia with and without personality disorder. The specific aim of the study was to assess the efficacy of a 6 week therapeutic program designed for social phobia (SSRIs and CBT) in patients suffering from social phobia with comorbid personality disorder (17 patients) and social phobia without comorbid personality disorder (18 patients). The patients were regularly assessed in weeks 0, 2, 4 and 6 using the CGI (Clinical Global Improvement) for severity, LSAS (Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale), and in self-assessments BAI (Beck Anxiety Inventory) and BDI (Beck Depression Inventory). Patients in both groups improved their scores in most of the assessment instruments used. A combination of CBT and pharmacotherapy proved to be the most effective treatment for patients suffering with social phobia with or without comorbid personality disorder. Treatment efficacy in patients with social phobia without personality disorder was significantly better than in the group with social phobia comorbid with personality disorder for CGI and specific inventory for social phobia - LSAS. The scores on the subjective depression inventory (BDI) also showed significantly greater decrease over the treatment in the group without personality disorder. The treatment effect between groups did not differ in subjective general anxiety scales BAI.\nQuestion: Is there any influence of personality disorder on the short term intensive group cognitive behavioral therapy of social phobia?", "gt": "Our study showed that patients suffering from social phobia and comorbid personality disorder showed a smaller decrease in specific social phobia symptomatology during treatment compared than patients with social phobia without personality disorders.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Late-life depression is associated with increased subcortical white matter hyperintensities. There is some evidence that they are associated with a poorer response to acute treatment. Neurological signs and neuropsychological dysfunction are further evidence of abnormalities in the brain, but they have not been studied in relation to therapy resistance. A prospective study of 24 normal controls and 75 consecutive elderly (aged 65 to 85) patients with DSM-III-R major depression entered a naturalistic study of treatment. Assessment of response to monotherapy and then lithium augmentation or ECT created three outcome groups. Investigations included magnetic resonance brain imaging, neuropsychological and neurological examination. Response to monotherapy within 12 weeks was shown by 42.7%, a further 37.3% responded to lithium augmentation or ECT within 24 weeks and 20% had responded poorly to all treatments at 24 weeks. Subcortical hyperintensities were significantly increased in the more resistant patients. These included confluent deep white matter, multiple (>5) basal ganglia lesions and pontine reticular formation lesions. Most of the neuropsychological impairment was restricted to the resistant groups and was of a subcortico-frontal type. Extrapyramidal, frontal and pyramidal neurological signs characterized the resistant groups. The combination of extrapyramidal signs, pyramidal tract signs and impairment of motor hand sequencing strongly predicted resistance to 12 weeks of antidepressant monotherapy with 89% sensitivity and 95% specificity.\nQuestion: Is subcortical disease associated with a poor response to antidepressants?", "gt": "In late-life depression a poor response to antidepressant monotherapy can be expected in those patients with a frontal lobe syndrome, extrapyramidal signs or if MRI T2-weighted lesions are present in both the basal ganglia and the pontine reticular formation.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Yes, subcortical disease, as evidenced by increased subcortical white matter hyperintensities, is associated with a poorer response to antidepressant treatments in elderly patients with major depression.

The following MS markers were assessed in the offspring (n=439): body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, blood pressure, homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance as well as fasting plasma glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol (high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein and total cholesterol), insulin and leptin levels. Walking-biking PA in pregnancy is associated with unchanged or subtle, adverse changes of distinct MS markers among offspring including lower levels of HDL cholesterol (ratio 0.95 (95% CI 0.92 to 0.98) per 1 h increment in walking-biking), a higher diastolic blood pressure (difference 1.12 (95% CI 0.03 to 2.20) mm Hg/1 h increment) and a higher BMI (ratio 1.03 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.05) per 1 h increment). In separate analyses in males, these associations persisted and additional adverse associations were found for triglycerides, systolic blood pressure, waist circumference and leptin. No associations were detected with other measures of PA.\nQuestion: Does physical activity during pregnancy adversely influence markers of the metabolic syndrome in adult offspring?", "gt": "The study did not substantiate any protective effects of PA in pregnancy. In contrast, data suggested that high amounts of daily walking-biking in pregnancy may have adverse effects on levels of HDL cholesterol, diastolic blood pressure and BMI in young adult offspring.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the context provided, certain types of physical activity during pregnancy, specifically walking and biking, are associated with subtle adverse changes in some markers of the metabolic syndrome in 20-year-old offspring. Specifically, higher levels of walking and biking during pregnancy are linked to lower levels of HDL cholesterol, higher diastolic blood pressure, and a higher BMI in the offspring. For males, these associations persisted and additional adverse associations were found for triglycerides, systolic blood pressure, waist circumference, and leptin. However, no associations were detected for other measures of physical activity, such as PA at work, leisure time PA, or sport participation. Therefore, the adverse influence appears to be specific to walking and biking activities during pregnancy and may differ by sex, with males showing more pronounced effects."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Tracheal drug administration is a route for drug delivery during cardiopulmonary resuscitation when intravenous access is not immediately available. However, tracheal adrenaline (epinephrine) injection has been recently shown to be associated with detrimental decrease in blood pressure. This was attributed to exaggerated early beta2 mediated effects unopposed by alpha-adrenergic vasoconstriction. We hypothesized that endobronchial adrenaline administration is associated with better drug absorption, which may abolish the deleterious drop of blood pressure associated with tracheal drug administration. To determine haemodynamic variables after endobronchial adrenaline administration in a non-arrest canine model. Prospective, randomized, laboratory study. Adrenaline (0.02, 0.05, 0.1 mg/kg) diluted with normal saline was injected into the bronchial tree of five anaesthetized dogs. Injection of 10-ml saline served as control. Heart rate, blood pressure and arterial blood gases were monitored for 60 min after drug instillation. The protocol was repeated after 1 week. Adrenaline at a dose of 0.02 mg/kg produced only a minor initial decrease in diastolic (from 90 +/- 5 to 78 +/- 3 mmHg, P=0.05), and mean blood pressure (from 107 +/- 4 to 100 +/- 3 mmHg, P=0.05), in all dogs. This effect lasted less then 30 s following the drug administration. In contrast, higher adrenaline doses (0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg) produced an immediate increase in diastolic (from 90 +/- 5 to 120 +/- 7 mmHg; and from 90 +/- 5 to 170 +/- 6 mmHg, respectively), and mean blood pressure (from 107 +/- 4 to 155 +/- 10 mmHg; and from 107 +/- 4 to 219 +/- 6 mmHg, respectively). All adrenaline doses resulted in an immediate increase in systolic blood pressure and pulse. Endobronchial administration of saline (control) affected none of the haemodynamic variables.\nQuestion: Endobronchial adrenaline: should it be reconsidered?", "gt": "In a non-arrest model, endobronchial adrenaline administration, as opposed to the effect of tracheal adrenaline, produced only a minor decrease in diastolic and mean blood pressure. We suggest that endobronchial adrenaline administration should be investigated further in a CPR low-flow model when maintaining adequate diastolic pressure may be crucial for survival.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the information provided, endobronchial adrenaline administration appears to have a different hemodynamic profile compared to tracheal administration. In the study conducted on a non-arrest canine model, endobronchial adrenaline administration resulted in several notable effects:\n\n1. **Dose-dependent Hemodynamic Response**: At the lowest dose tested (0.02 mg/kg), there was only a minor and transient decrease in diastolic and mean blood pressure, which lasted less than 30 seconds. Higher doses (0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg) led to significant increases in both diastolic and mean blood pressure, alongside an immediate increase in systolic blood pressure and pulse.\n\n2. **Comparison with Tracheal Administration**: The study suggests that tracheal adrenaline (epinephrine) administration is associated with a detrimental decrease in blood pressure due to exaggerated beta2-mediated effects without the counterbalancing alpha-adrenergic vasoconstriction. In contrast, endobronchial administration at higher doses resulted in an increase in blood pressure, which may indicate better absorption or a different mechanism of action that avoids the initial hypotensive phase observed with tracheal administration.\n\n3. **Safety and Efficacy**: The study does not report any adverse events associated with endobronchial adrenaline administration, and the control group (saline administration) did not affect hemodynamic variables, suggesting that the observed effects were due to the adrenaline.\n\nGiven these findings, endobronchial adrenaline administration could be reconsidered as a potentially safer and more effective alternative to tracheal administration, particularly in situations where immediate intravenous access is not available. However, further clinical research in human subjects would be necessary to confirm these findings and to determine optimal dosing and safety profiles in a clinical setting."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: The aim of the study was to investigate whether changes in the level of oxidized LDL (oxLDL) over 2-years contribute to the development of subclinical macroangiopathy and/or microvascular complications in patients with DM1. Basic clinical and biochemical parameters and oxLDL level were measured in 70 patients at baseline and after 2 years of the study. In addition, an ultrasonographic study was performed to assess the carotid intima media thickness (IMT). Patients did not differ according to basic clinical and biochemical parameters at the beginning and after 2 years of the study. IMT increased (p=0.000001) whereas oxLDL level decreased (p=0.00001) in DM1 patients during 2 years. Multivariate regression analysis showed that oxLDL independently influences IMT in DM1 patients (\u03b2=0.454, R2=0.35). Further, positive correlations between oxLDL value and LDL-C concentration (r=0.585, p<0.05, n=70) and between oxLDL level and apo-B concentration have been established (r=0.610, p<0.05, n=70).

The study does not directly link oxLDL levels to the development of microvascular complications. Therefore, based on the provided information, we can conclude that there is evidence for a role of oxLDL in atherosclerotic plaque formation, but the direct contribution of oxLDL to microvascular complications is not explicitly demonstrated in this study."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: The aim of this study was to evaluate therapy response in patients undergoing cetuximab-CapIri-based chemoradiation for rectal cancer using dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI). The volumetric degree of tumor regression and contrast media perfusion were compared to the results of the histopathologic ypTN staging. 33 patients were examined using a 1.5-T scanner with repetitive 2D FLASH sequences after contrast media application. All patients were examined twice - before therapy and immediately before surgery. In all patients, the tumor volume decreased (mean 72 +/- 16%). In 25/33 patients, the slope of the contrast media enhancement curve decreased (mean 31 +/- 20%). In histopathologically proven downstaging after therapy, the decrease in slope was significantly higher than in the group without downstaging, and the decrease in slope was better for distinguishing between 'responder' and 'non-responder' than the decrease in volume.\nQuestion: Can dynamic MR imaging predict response in patients with rectal cancer undergoing cetuximab-based neoadjuvant chemoradiation?", "gt": "Using dMRI helps to identify responders undergoing cetuximab-based chemoradiation better than volume decrease alone.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Yes, dynamic MR imaging can predict response in patients with rectal cancer undergoing cetuximab-based neoadjuvant chemoradiation.

Additionally, the decrease in the slope of the enhancement curve was a better indicator for distinguishing between 'responder' and 'non-responder' patients compared to the decrease in tumor volume. This suggests that dMRI, particularly the analysis of contrast media perfusion, can be a useful tool in predicting therapy response in these patients."}

To determine if significant differences in life satisfaction exist between stroke survivors with and without functional limitations and whether specific functional limitations, as well as participation in outpatient rehabilitation affect the odds of reported life satisfaction for stroke survivors. Chi square analysis was used to examine data from the 2013 BRFSS to determine the relationship of functional limitations as well as participation in rehabilitation services to life satisfaction for stroke survivors. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine what variables increased the odds of reported poor life satisfaction. Stroke survivors experiencing difficulty with cognition, depression and IADLs showed significantly lower life satisfaction than those who did not experience these functional limitations. Survivors exhibiting activity limitations had almost twice the odds of reporting poor life satisfaction and those experiencing limitations in cognition and IADLs had 2.88 times and 1.81 times the odds as others without these limitations of reporting poor life satisfaction, respectively.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: The most appropriate approach to the repair of large paraesophageal hernias remains controversial. Despite early results of excellent outcomes after laparoscopic repair, recent reports of high recurrence require that this approach be reevaluated. For this study, 60 primary paraesophageal hernias consecutively repaired at one institution from 1990 to 2002 were reviewed. These 25 open transabdominal and 35 laparoscopic repairs were compared for operative, short-, and long-term outcomes on the basis of quality-of -life questionnaires and radiographs. No difference in patient characteristics was detected. Laparoscopic repair resulted in lower blood loss, fewer intraoperative complications, and a shorter length of hospital stay. No difference in general or disease-specific quality-of-life was documented. Radiographic follow-up was available for 78% open and 91% laparoscopic repairs, showing anatomic recurrence rates of 44% and 23%, respectively (p = 0.11).\nQuestion: Should laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repair be abandoned in favor of the open approach?", "gt": "Laparoscopic repair should remain in the forefront for the management of paraesophageal hernias.

The laparoscopic approach resulted in lower blood loss, fewer intraoperative complications, and a shorter length of hospital stay compared to the open approach. Additionally, there was no difference in general or disease-specific quality-of-life between the two groups.\n\nWhile the laparoscopic repair showed a numerically lower anatomic recurrence rate (23%) compared to the open approach (44%), the difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.11).

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Topical capsaicin application was shown to reduce infarct size in experimental animal models. We hypothesized that cardioprotective properties of topical capsaicin application could be related to its hypothermic effect. In the first arm of the study, anesthetized rats received capsaicin cream (Caps group) or vehicle (Control group, Ctrl) applied either 15 or 30\u00a0min prior to a 30-min coronary artery occlusion followed by 2-h reperfusion. Core body temperature was allowed to run its course, and was monitored via rectal probe. At the end of the protocol, hearts were excised and risk zone and infarct size were measured. In an additional set of animals, hearts were excised immediately after a 15-min application of capsaicin/vehicle, and were used to measure phosphorylated Akt and Erk1/2 with western blots. In the second arm of the study Ctrl (n\u2009=\u20096) and Caps-treated (n\u2009=\u20095) animals were subjected to the same protocol as rats in the first arm, but core body temperature was maintained at 36\u00a0\u00b0C. In the first arm of the study, capsaicin produced a rapid decrease in rectal temperature ranging from 0.22 to 1.78\u00a0\u00b0C at pre-occlusion, with a median level of 0.97\u00a0\u00b0C. A capsaicin-induced temperature decrease of>0.97\u00a0\u00b0C was associated with a 31.2\u00a0% smaller infarct compared to the control group. Capsaicin treatment induced an increase in the levels of phosphorylated Akt and Erk1/2 at the end of capsaicin cream application. No increase in the phosphorylation of downstream p70S6 was observed. Levels of phosphorylated Akt- and Erk1/2 did not correlate with temperature changes after treatment. In the second arm of the study, in which body core temperature was maintained at 36\u00a0\u00b0C, no change in the infarct size was observed in the capsaicin vs. control group.\nQuestion: Capsaicin-induced cardioprotection. Is hypothermia or the salvage kinase pathway involved?", "gt": "In the current study we for the first time demonstrated that the capsaicin induced cardioprotective effect might be related to mild hypothermia, caused by capsaicin topical application. The salvage kinase pathway appears not to be critical for capsaicin-induced cardioprotection.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the information provided, it appears that the cardioprotective effect of capsaicin is more closely associated with the activation of the salvage kinase pathway rather than hypothermia. This conclusion is supported by several observations from the study:\n\n1. **Temperature and Infarct Size Relationship**: In the first arm of the study, a decrease in body temperature due to capsaicin application was associated with a smaller infarct size, indicating that hypothermia might contribute to the cardioprotective effect. However, in the second arm, where body temperature was maintained at a constant level (36\u00b0C) to eliminate the hypothermic effect of capsaicin, no change in infarct size was observed between the capsaicin-treated and control groups. This suggests that the hypothermic effect alone is not responsible for the cardioprotective effect of capsaicin.\n\n2. **Activation of Salvage Kinase Pathway**: Capsaicin treatment led to an increase in the levels of phosphorylated Akt and Erk1/2, which are key components of the salvage kinase pathway. This pathway is known to play a role in cardioprotection. The fact that phosphorylation of these kinases was observed, and that it did not correlate with temperature changes, indicates that the activation of this pathway might be the primary mechanism through which capsaicin exerts its cardioprotective effects.\n\n3. **Lack of Correlation with Temperature**: The levels of phosphorylated Akt and Erk1/2 did not correlate with changes in temperature after capsaicin treatment, further supporting the idea that the activation of these kinases, rather than hypothermia, is the main factor behind capsaicin's cardioprotective properties.\n\nIn summary, while capsaicin-induced hypothermia may contribute to the overall cardioprotective effect, the primary mechanism appears to involve the activation of the salvage kinase pathway, as evidenced by the increased phosphorylation of Akt and Erk1/2."}

Treatment effects were determined using the Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Impact Index, the quality-of-life question of the International Prostate Symptom Score, a similarly phrased question about sexual satisfaction, the maximum urinary flow rate, the postvoid residual urine volume, and the overall efficacy and tolerability. The results were analysed statistically for differences between dosing times, using analysis of covariance for the quantitative variables and logistic regression for the qualitative variables. While no specific recommendation about the dosing time was given in the trial, the retrospective analysis showed that 4420 and 2087 patients received tamsulosin in the morning and evening, respectively. Both groups had similar values for all variables before treatment. The efficacy and tolerability of tamsulosin treatment was also similar in both groups; there were small advantages for morning dosing, which were statistically significant because there were many patients.\nQuestion: Does the time of administration (morning or evening) affect the tolerability or efficacy of tamsulosin?", "gt": "In contrast to other alpha-blockers, night-time dosing is not necessary to improve the tolerability or efficacy of tamsulosin.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the provided context, the time of administration (morning or evening) does not significantly affect the tolerability or efficacy of tamsulosin in the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms.

Multivariable logistic models were used to quantify the impact of surgeon's experience (measured by the number of prior performed RP) on surgical margin status, postoperative continence and operative time. Negative surgical margin rate was 86 % for patients with pT2 stage, and continence rate at 3 years after RP was 94 %. Patients with negative surgical margin had lower preoperative PSA level (p = 0.02), lower pT stage (p<0.001) and lower Gleason score (p<0.001). The influence of the experience of the surgeon was nonlinear, positive and highly significant up to 750 performed surgeries (75-90 % negative surgical margin) (p<0.01).

Categorical interpretive analysis was performed. The adolescents and prevention professional indicated differences between boys and girls in drug and alcohol use. The significances, reasons associated with the consumption and the patterns of consumption were perceived differently by each sex. To lose weight, calm down or an image of rebelliousness was related to girls who smoked, while boys smoked less because they did more sports. The perception of certain precocity of drug consumption was associated with the step from school to Higher Education Institutions. They found smoking associated with a good social image among their groups. Adolescents showed the ineffectiveness of the campaigns and prevention messages they received, incoherence of adults between messages and actions, and the attraction of all behaviours that are banned.

Therefore, the answer to the question \"Poor agreement between commercial ELISAs for plasma fetuin-A: An effect of protein glycosylation?\" is yes, the study indicates that the protein's glycosylation status could be a factor affecting the agreement between commercial ELISAs for plasma fetuin-A."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Ultrasonography (US) is used in rheumatology to assess small joints in inflammatory arthritis. Recently there has been some investigation into the utility of US in osteoarthritis (OA), however there has been little comparison of US to other imaging modalities in OA. This study aimed to compare the detection of osteophytosis and joint space narrowing (JSN) by US and conventional radiography (CR) in OA of the hand. with OA of the hand underwent US and CR examination of the small joints of both hands to identify osteophytosis and joint space narrowing. 1106 joints of 37 patients were imaged with US and CR. US detected osteophytosis in 448 joints, compared to CR that detected osteophytosis in 228 joints (approximately 30% fewer joints). Where osteophytosis was detected by US but not CR, this was usually proximal to the joint line. Joint space narrowing was detected in 450 joints by US, but only 261 joints by CR. The distribution of US and CR detected osteoarthritis changes in this cohort was consistent with population studies of radiographic hand OA, although metacarpophalangeal (MCP) involvement was higher than might be expected\nQuestion: Can ultrasonography improve on radiographic assessment in osteoarthritis of the hands?", "gt": "US detected more osteophytosis and joint space narrowing than CR in OA of the hand.

We performed a retrospective cohort study involving all patients with enterococcal total hip or knee arthroplasty infection treated at our institution from 1969 through 1999. The outcome for patients treated with combination systemic antimicrobial therapy (a cell wall-active agent and an aminoglycoside) versus monotherapy with a cell wall-active agent was analyzed. Fifty episodes of prosthetic joint infection due to enterococci occurred in 47 patients. The median duration of follow-up was 1253 days (range, 29-4610 days). The median age at the time of diagnosis was 70 years (range, 32-89 years). Fifty percent of episodes (25 of 50 episodes) occurred in male patients; 48% (24 of 50 episodes) involved total hip or knee arthroplasty. The estimate of 2-year survival free of treatment failure was 94% (95% confidence interval [CI], 83%-100%) for patients treated with 2-stage exchange, 76% (95% CI, 58%-100%) for patients treated with resection arthroplasty, and 80% (95% CI, 51.6%-100%) for patients treated with debridement and retention of the components (P=.9). The overall rate of 2-year survival free of treatment failure was 88% (95% CI, 77%-100%) for patients treated with monotherapy and 72% (95% CI, 54%-96%) for patients treated with combination therapy (P=.1). The development of cranial nerve VIII toxicity was significantly more common among patients receiving combination therapy (P=.002).

The roles of attitudes toward contraception, pregnancy and fertility remain relatively unexplored. Knowledge of contraceptive methods and attitudes about contraception, pregnancy, childbearing and fertility were assessed among 602 unmarried women aged 18-29 at risk for unintended pregnancy who participated in the 2009 National Survey of Reproductive and Contraceptive Knowledge. The contribution of attitudes to racial and ethnic disparities in effective method use was assessed via mediation analysis, using a series of regression models. Blacks and Latinas were more likely than whites to believe that the government encourages contraceptive use to limit minority populations (odds ratio, 2.5 for each). Compared with white women, Latinas held more favorable attitudes toward pregnancy (2.5) and childbearing (coefficient, 0.3) and were more fatalistic about the timing of pregnancy (odds ratio, 2.3); blacks were more fatalistic about life in general (2.0). Only one attitude, skepticism that the government ensures contraceptive safety, was associated with contraceptive use (0.7), but this belief did not differ by race or ethnicity. Although blacks and Latinas used less effective methods than whites (0.3 and 0.4, respectively), attitudes did not explain disparities.

To determine the effect of a health education intervention on trainee teachers' knowledge, attitude and first aid management of epilepsy. The effect of a health education intervention in first aid management of epilepsy was assessed among 226 trainee teachers, attending the Federal College of Education (Technical), Akoka. This was done using a quasi-experimental study design. Data were analyzed using the SPSS version 15. The respondents had a median age of 22 years with a range of 18 to 56 years. The majority of them were females (68.6%), single (79.2%), Christians (81.9%), Yoruba (70.4%) and in first year (100 level) of their study (69.9%). The highest proportion was from the Accounting department (46.0%). A consistent increase in responses to items on knowledge, attitude and first aid management of epileptic seizure items from baseline to post-intervention was observed. For instance, the proportion of responses that epileptic seizures originate from the brain significantly (p = 0.025) increased from 62.5% at baseline to 74.1% after intervention. Generally, slightly more than two-fifths (44.2%) and about two thirds (61.9%) of the respondents were observed to have poor knowledge and negative attitude to epilepsy respectively at baseline. Overall, giving health education on epilepsy led to a reduction in the proportion of respondents with poor knowledge by 15.5% (increase of good knowledge by 29.6%), decrease of negative attitude by 16.4% and increase of good first aid management skill by 25.0%. The knowledge scores were significantly associated with age (p = 0.001), marital status (p = 0.003) and department (p = 0.004) while the attitude scores were significantly associated with teaching duration (p = 0.020).

Participants were all checked for urolithiasis by radiological investigations. Blood samples were analyzed for biochemistry parameters including calcium and uric acid. 24-h urine samples were analyzed to investigate oxalate, citrate calcium, uric acid, magnesium, sodium and creatinine. Men/women ratio and mean age were similar between group I and II (p>0.05). A presence or history of urolithiasis was detected in 8 (20%) and 2 (%5) patients in group I and II, respectively (p<0.05).

Admissions to NSW public and private hospitals in 1999-2000 (1.8 million admissions against a NSW population of 6.4 million). Inequalities in hospitalisation rates were expressed as rate ratios across the most and least disadvantaged 20% of the NSW population. Public hospital admission rates for people aged 0-60 years were 24-35% higher for the most disadvantaged 20% of the NSW population than for the least disadvantaged 20%. For 70+ year-olds the direction of this difference was reversed--being 14% lower for the most disadvantaged 20% of the population (5% higher for public patients). For private hospitals this reversal prevailed for all age groups (23-49% lower). For all hospitals it was 16% and 27% lower for 60-69 and 70+ year-olds respectively, with higher admission rates for top SES 60+ year-olds most pronounced for renal dialysis, chemotherapy, colonoscopies and other diagnostic scopes, rehabilitation and follow-up, and cataract operations.\nQuestion: Hospital admissions by socio-economic status: does the 'inverse care law' apply to older Australians?", "gt": "While the 'inverse care law' did apply to 60+ year-olds, it did not apply either to younger NSW hospital users or to public patients in public hospitals.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the provided context, the 'inverse care law' does not uniformly apply to older Australians, especially those with high socio-economic status (SES) in New South Wales (NSW).

A randomized patient study was undertaken to evaluate the dose reduction by thyroid lead shields and assess their practicality in a clinical setting. Sixty-five patients attending for endovascular treatment of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and aneurysms were randomized into one of 2 groups a) No Thyroid Shield and b) Thyroid Lead Shield. Two thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) were placed over the thyroid gland (1 on each side) at constant positions on each patient in both groups. A thyroid lead shield (Pb eq. 0.5 mm) was placed around the neck of patients in the thyroid lead shield group after the neurointerventional radiologist had obtained satisfactory working access above the neck.

Here's a breakdown of the key points that support this conclusion:\n\n1. **Overexpression of Glut in Tumors**: The study indicates that in certain tumor models, particularly the LX-1 human lung tumor xenograft, Glut density was significantly higher than in other tissues. This suggests that overexpression of Glut could indeed be a general characteristic of some tumors, making it a potential target for tumor imaging.\n\n2. **Specific Binding Agents**: The research involved the use of two compounds, [125I]HPP forskolin and [3H]cytochalasin B, which bind to Glut. The binding studies showed that [3H]cytochalasin B binds to Glut in a manner competitive with D-glucose but not L-glucose, indicating specificity for Glut. This specificity is crucial for targeting Glut in tumors.\n\n3. **Biodistribution Studies**: However, the biodistribution studies of the two compounds in a tumor model that overexpressed Glut did not show localization in the LX-1 tumors. This suggests that while Glut may be overexpressed in certain tumors, the compounds used in this study did not accumulate selectively in these tumors, which is a critical requirement for effective tumor imaging agents.\n\n4. **Glut Localization in Tumors**: The study also noted that Glut density was highest in poorly vascularized regions of tumors. This observation suggests that the upregulation of Glut might be related to a biofeedback mechanism, possibly in response to low oxygen or nutrient conditions. This could potentially complicate the use of Glut as a target for imaging, depending on the tumor's microenvironment.\n\nIn summary, while the overexpression of Glut in certain tumors provides a theoretical basis for targeting these proteins for imaging purposes, the current study indicates challenges in achieving selective accumulation of the tested compounds in tumors. Further research, possibly involving the development of new or modified compounds with improved tumor selectivity, would be necessary to establish the feasibility of Glut as a target for tumor imaging."}

The retrospective cohort included all patients who underwent a nonemergent colectomy from January 1, 2007 to January 1, 2008 at a 2-hospital system. Data collected included patient demographics, patient quality outcomes, complications, and GME involvement. Patient quality outcomes were based on compliance with the Surgical Care Improvement Project (SCIP) guidelines. A total of 159 nonemergent colectomies were analyzed. The GME group accounted for 116 (73%) patients. A significant difference was found in several SCIP process-based measures of quality when comparing the GME group with the non-GME group. Postoperative antibiotics were more likely to be stopped within 24 hours (p = 0.010), and preoperative heparin and postoperative deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis were more likely to be administered (p<0.001). Additionally, patients in the GME group showed improved quality outcomes as there were significantly fewer postoperative complications (p<0.001) and a shorter duration of stay (p = 0.008). The use of gastrointestinal prophylaxis was more common in the non-GME group (p = 0.002).

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: A substantial proportion of patients with clinical stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have more advanced disease on final pathologic review. We studied potentially modifiable factors that may predict pathologic upstaging. Data of patients with clinical stage I NSCLC undergoing resection were obtained from the National Cancer Database. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify variables that predict upstaging. From 1998 to 2010, 55,653 patients with clinical stage I NSCLC underwent resection; of these, 9,530 (17%) had more advanced disease on final pathologic review. Of the 9,530 upstaged patients, 27% had T3 or T4 tumors, 74% had positive lymph nodes (n>0), and 4% were found to have metastatic disease (M1). Patients with larger tumors (38 mm vs 29 mm, p<0.001) and a delay greater than 8 weeks from diagnosis to resection were more likely to be upstaged. Upstaged patients also had more lymph nodes examined (10.9 vs 8.2, p<0.001) and were more likely to have positive resection margins (10% vs 2%, p<0.001). Median survival was lower in upstaged patients (39 months vs 73 months). Predictors of upstaging in multivariate regression analysis included larger tumor size, delay in resection greater 8 weeks, positive resection margins, and number of lymph nodes examined. There was a linear relationship between the number of lymph nodes examined and the odds of upstaging (1 to 3 nodes, odds ratio [OR] 2.01;>18 nodes OR 6.14).\nQuestion: Pathologic Upstaging in Patients Undergoing Resection for Stage I Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Are There Modifiable Predictors?", "gt": "Pathologic upstaging is a common finding with implications for treatment and outcomes in clinical stage I NSCLC.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Muscarinic antagonists such as tolterodine are the treatment of choice for overactive bladder (OAB). We determined the impact of concomitant stress incontinence (SI) on the therapeutic effects of tolterodine in patients with OAB with and without concomitant SI. Data from an open label, observational study involving 2,250 patients with OAB symptoms were analyzed for baseline frequency, urgency and incontinence, and alterations in these symptoms while on 12-week treatment with 2 mg tolterodine twice daily. Data are shown as the mean +/- SD. The statistical significance of differences in treatment effects was determined by multiple regression analysis, adjusting for gender, age and baseline symptom intensity. Concomitant I to III degree SI according to the Stamey grading was present in 31%, 15% and 2% of patients, respectively, and it was associated with increasing basal incontinence, although only III degree SI was associated with greater baseline frequency or urgency. In the overall group tolterodine decreased frequency, urgency and urge incontinence from 12.4 +/- 4.3 to 7.7 +/- 2.7, 8.4 +/- 5.1 to 2.0 +/- 3.0 and 3.4 +/- 4.2 to 0.8 +/- 2.0 episodes daily, respectively. On multiple linear regression analysis I and II degree SI had a minor, if any, effect on this improvement, while III degree SI was statistically associated with a smaller decrease in frequency (by 1.4 +/- 0.4 micturitions daily, p = 0.0002) and incontinence (by 2.1 +/- 0.3 episodes daily, p<0.0001) but with similar alterations in the number of urge episodes.\nQuestion: Does concomitant stress incontinence alter the efficacy of tolterodine in patients with overactive bladder?", "gt": "Concomitant I or II degree SI has little effect on the efficacy of tolterodine in OAB cases.

We sought to measure patient satisfaction with procedures performed by a hospitalist-supervised, intern-based procedure service (HPS) with a focus on patient perception of bedside communication. This was a prospective survey. We surveyed all patients referred to the HPS for bedside thoracentesis, paracentesis, lumbar puncture, and arthrocentesis at a single academic medical center. Following each procedure, surveys were administered to English-speaking patients who could provide informed consent. Survey questions focused on patients' satisfaction with specific aspects of procedure performance as well as the quality and impact of communication with the patient and between members of the team. Of 95 eligible patients, 65 (68%) completed the survey. Nearly all patients were satisfied or very satisfied with the overall experience (100%), explanation of informed consent (98%), pain control (92%), and expertise (95%) of physicians. The majority of patients were satisfied with procedure duration (88%) and in those with therapeutic procedures most (89%) were satisfied with improvement in symptoms.

Rats were divided into five groups of normal and diabetic. Diabetes was induced with streptozocin (40 mg/kg, i.v.). Normal rats used water (CN) or vanadium (1 mg/ml VOSO4, VTN). Diabetic rats used water (CD), water plus daily neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin injection (80 U/kg, ITD) or vanadium (VTD). Blood samples were taken for blood glucose (BG, mg/dL) and insulin (ng/dL) measurements. After two months, the pancreata of sacrificed rats were prepared for islet staining. Pre-treated normal BG was 88 \u00b1 2, and diabetic BG was 395 \u00b1 9. The final BG in CD, VTD, and ITD was 509 \u00b1 22, 138 \u00b1 14, and 141 \u00b1 14, respectively. Insulin in VTN (0.75 \u00b1 0.01) and VTD (0.78 \u00b1 0.01) was similar, higher than CD (0.51 \u00b1 0.07) but lower than CN (2.51 \u00b1 0.02).

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Loss of voluntary contraction of the external anal sphincter is thought to be a factor in fecal incontinence.

The mean age of these patients was 58 years. The results have been compared with those for 12 similar non-pull-through procedures performed during the same period. There was no operative mortality. An anastomotic leakage and a hemorrhagic gastropathy occurred in the LTPT group. During a mean follow-up period of 18 months (range, 12-26 months), there was no local relapse. Four patients manifested moderate incontinence. No significant differences in functional outcome were observed between the LTPT and control groups.\nQuestion: Restorative proctectomy with colon pouch-anal anastomosis by laparoscopic transanal pull-through: an available option for low rectal cancer?", "gt": "The authors' experience supports use of the LTPT procedure with colonic pouch-anal anastomosis for selected lower rectal cancers with indications for a laparoscopic approach as an appropriate and reproducible surgical treatment.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the context provided, restorative proctectomy with colon pouch-anal anastomosis by laparoscopic transanal pull-through (LTPT) appears to be an available option for treating low rectal cancer.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: The aim of this paper is to determine the possible association between five different profiles of immunohistochemical expression related to clinical, histopathological and immunohistochemical known prognostic value variables for breast cancer. A total of 194 breast carcinoma tumour samples were studied. In this study five groups or immunohistochemical profiles were defined, based on expression of hormone receptors (oestrogen or progesterone) and/or Her2/neu (luminal-type A, luminal-type B, mixed profile, Her2/neu profile and triple-negative-type profile) and we studied whether there are differences between them with regard to clinical, histopathological and immunohistochemical variables that have a known prognostic significance. In the series we found 134 (69%) cases corresponding to a luminal immunophenotype, of which 98 (50.5%) were from the luminal A group and 36 (18.6%) from luminal B. Twenty-nine cases (15.9%) were triple-negative, 18 (9.3%) mixed and 13 (6.7%) Her2/neu type. It is worth noting the relationship between the triple-negative and Her2/neu immunophenotypes and the more poorly differentiated histological forms (62% and 60%, respectively) and between the luminal A group and well-differentiated tumours (p = 0.008). Expression of ki67 was high in the triple-negative group (73.9%) and low in the luminal A group (26.3%; p = 0.001). The expression of p53 was also greater for the Her2/neu (55.5%) and triple-negative (60.8%) groups (p = 0.0005) than for the others.\nQuestion: Immunohistochemical characterisation of breast cancer: towards a new clasification?", "gt": "The subgroups without hormone receptor expression, with Her2/neu overexpression or without (triple-negative group), have characteristics associated with variables of a poorer prognosis. The lack of progesterone receptor expression also seems to be associated with these.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "The immunohistochemical characterisation of breast cancer, as described in the context provided, indeed points towards a more nuanced classification based on the expression profiles of certain key biomarkers. This approach classifies breast tumors into distinct subtypes based on the expression of hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone) and the Her2/neu receptor. The study identifies five main immunohistochemical profiles: luminal-type A, luminal-type B, mixed profile, Her2/neu profile, and triple-negative type. Each profile is associated with different prognostic values and clinical outcomes.\n\nThe breakdown of the 194 breast carcinoma tumor samples into these five profiles reveals significant differences in histopathological characteristics and the expression of other important markers like Ki67 and p53. For instance, the luminal A group is predominantly associated with well-differentiated tumors, while the triple-negative and Her2/neu profiles are linked with poorly differentiated forms. Additionally, the expression levels of Ki67 and p53 vary significantly across these profiles, with the triple-negative group showing high Ki67 expression and both the Her2/neu and triple-negative groups having higher p53 expression compared to the luminal types.\n\nThis detailed classification based on immunohistochemical profiles is a step towards a more personalized approach in the management of breast cancer, as it can help in predicting disease behavior and in tailoring treatment strategies according to the specific subtype of breast cancer a patient has. This method moves beyond traditional classifications and provides a more comprehensive understanding of the molecular characteristics of breast tumors, potentially leading to improved clinical outcomes."}

The associations of ADL stage and perception of unmet needs for home accessibility features with a history of falling within the past year (none, once, or multiple times) were explored after accounting for sociodemographic characteristics and comorbidities using a multinomial logistic regression model.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Venous blood is the usual sample for measuring various biomarkers, including 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD). However, it can prove challenging in infants and young children. Hence the finger-prick capillary collection is an alternative, being a relatively simple procedure perceived to be less invasive. We elected to validate the use of capillary blood sampling for 25OHD quantification by liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS). Venous and capillary blood samples were simultaneously collected from 15 preschool-aged children with asthma 10days after receiving 100,000IU of vitamin-D3 or placebo and 20 apparently healthy adult volunteers. 25OHD was measured by an in-house LC/MS-MS method. The venous 25OHD values varied between 23 and 255nmol/l. The venous and capillary blood total 25OHD concentrations highly correlated (r(2)=0.9963). The mean difference (bias) of capillary blood 25OHD compared to venous blood was 2.0 (95% CI: -7.5, 11.5) nmol/l.\nQuestion: Assessing vitamin D nutritional status: Is capillary blood adequate?", "gt": "Our study demonstrates excellent agreement with no evidence of a clinically important bias between venous and capillary serum 25OHD concentrations measured by LC/MS-MS over a wide range of values.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Lung tissue is metabolically active and consumes oxygen. The oxygen content difference between arterial and mixed venous blood does not include the effect of pulmonary tissue oxygen uptake. Thus, oxygen consumption (VO2) of the lung should be reflected as a difference between VO2 measured by gas exchange and VO2 derived by the Fick principle. The purpose of this study was to measure in clinical conditions this difference (taken to represent the VO2 of the lung), and to evaluate the sources of error in lung VO2 estimation. Nine patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting were studied. VO2 was measured by indirect calorimetry (VO2gasex) and compared to Fick-derived VO2 (VO2Fick) after induction of anaesthesia, after closure of the chest, at admission to intensive care, after stabilization of haemodynamics and during weaning from mechanical ventilation. The Fick-derived VO2 was calculated from blood samples taken at the beginning and at the end of each 20 min measurement period, and the mean of 12 consecutive thermodilution cardiac output measurements taken during each 20 min measurement period. VO2gasex was higher than VO2Fick (P<0.01; in all except 4 of 45 measurements). The difference between the measured and the calculated VO2 was 33 +/- 25 ml/min (mean +/- SD, range -16-100 ml/min). This difference represented 14 +/- 3% (range 11-18%) of the whole body VO2. The VO2-difference was highest after the induction of anaesthesia (50 +/- 19 ml/min; range 20-41 ml/min, P<0.03) and lowest on arrival at the intensive care unit (10 +/- 16 ml/min; range -16-39 ml/min). Core temperature did not correlate with the oxygen consumption difference.\nQuestion: Calculated versus measured oxygen consumption during and after cardiac surgery. Is it possible to estimate lung oxygen consumption?", "gt": "A constant difference between measured and calculated VO2 can be detected in carefully controlled clinical conditions. The difference between the two methods is due to both lung oxygen consumption and errors in the measurement of VO2 thermodilution cardiac output, haemoglobin and blood oxygen contents.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: The objective of this national survey was to describe the routine use of procedures and technologies in Canadian hospitals providing maternity care, and to determine the extent to which current use was consistent with the existing evidence and recommended guidelines for maternal and newborn care. Representatives of 572 hospitals providing maternity care across Canada were sent questionnaires in the spring and summer of 1993; 523 (91.4%) responded. The primary outcome measures consisted of the self-reported use of obstetric procedures and technologies (perineal shaves, enemas/suppositories, intravenous infusions, initial and continuous electronic fetal heart monitoring, episiotomy rates). Hospitals were grouped according to location, size (number of live births per year), and university affiliation status. The hospitals in the Prairie provinces, in Quebec, and in the Atlantic provinces were significantly less likely than those in Ontario to restrict their use of perineal shaves and enemas to women on admission in labor. Small hospitals were significantly more likely than large hospitals (>1000 live births) to restrict their use of intravenous infusions, and initial and continuous electronic fetal monitoring. The university-affiliated and nonteaching hospitals were significantly less likely than the university teaching hospitals to have episiotomy rates of less than 40 percent for primiparous women. Small hospitals were more likely than large hospitals to report episiotomy rates of less than 20 percent for multiparous women.\nQuestion: A national survey of use of obstetric procedures and technologies in Canadian hospitals: routine or based on existing evidence?", "gt": "Considerable variations occur in the routine use of obstetric procedures and technologies in Canadian hospitals providing maternity care, according to hospital location, size, and university affiliation status.

The survey highlights variations in practices across different types of hospitals and regions, suggesting that while some hospitals may be following evidence-based guidelines, others are adhering to more routine use of certain procedures.\n\nFor example, the survey found that hospitals in Ontario were more likely to restrict the use of perineal shaves and enemas to women admitted in labor, which could indicate a move towards more evidence-based practices, as these procedures might not always be necessary. However, the fact that hospitals in other regions were less likely to do so suggests that routine use may still be prevalent in those areas.\n\nAdditionally, the use of intravenous infusions and electronic fetal monitoring was more restricted in smaller hospitals compared to larger ones, potentially reflecting a more conservative approach in smaller hospitals, which could be more in line with evidence-based recommendations. On the other hand, episiotomy rates were notably different between teaching and non-teaching hospitals, with university-affiliated hospitals being less likely to have lower episiotomy rates for first-time mothers. This could imply that teaching hospitals might be more inclined to follow guidelines recommending lower episiotomy rates, while non-teaching hospitals may be practicing more routinely.\n\nIn summary, the survey indicates that while some practices align with existing evidence and guidelines, others seem to be routine, and there is significant variability across different types and sizes of hospitals in Canada."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: We compared the results from a video-assisted thoracoscopic sympathectomy (VTS) at the T4 denervation level with those from a VTS at the T3 level for the treatment of palmar hyperhydrosis (PH). Seventy patients with PH were prospectively followed for VTS at the T3 or T4 denervation levels for 6 months. The end points of this study were: absence of PH, compensatory hyperhydrosis (CH), and quality-of-life assessment. Sixty-seven patients reported a complete resolution of PH after surgery. One failure occurred in the T3 group and 2 in the T4 group. When anhydrosis was obtained, we noticed totally dry hands in 26 patients in the T3 group and 6 patients in the T4 group. The other 27 patients in the T4 group and 8 in the T3 group maintained a small level of sweating and were also considered to be therapeutic successes. At 6 months, 25 patients in the T4 group had some degree of CH (71.42%) and all patients in the T3 group (100%), though the T4 group had a lower degree of severity of CH at the 6-month follow-up (P<0.05).

Patients who developed a postoperative CSF leak within 30 days of surgery were compared with those who did not. Data collected included patient age, sex, body mass index (BMI), tumor size, tumor side, history of prior tumor treatment, operative time, surgical approach, and extent of resection. Both univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to evaluate all variables as risk factors of a postoperative CSF leak. A total of 457 patients were included in the study, with 45 patients (9.8%) developing a postoperative CSF leak. A significant association existed between increasing BMI and a CSF leak, with those classified as overweight (BMI 25-29.9), obese (BMI 30-39.9), or morbidly obese (BMI\u226540) having a 2.5-, 3-, and 6-fold increased risk, respectively. Patients undergoing a translabyrinthine (TL) approach experienced a higher rate of CSF leaks (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.3-4.6; p=0.005), as did those who had longer operative times (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.02-1.07; p=0.0006).

The patient's age and sex, medical history, presumed cause of arrest, use of CPR and immediate and long term survival rate were recorded. Immediate survival and survival to discharge following CPR. There were a total of 76 cardio-respiratory arrests and 70 resuscitation attempts in the episodes reviewed. The immediate success rate (46%) did not differ significantly from published real life figures (p=0.48). The resuscitation process appeared to follow current guidelines.

The most common cause of cardiac arrest was trauma with only a minor proportion of arrests due to cardio-respiratory causes such as myocardial infarction.\nQuestion: Resuscitation on television: realistic or ridiculous?", "gt": "Whilst the immediate success rate of CPR in medical television drama does not significantly differ from reality the lack of depiction of poorer medium to long term outcomes may give a falsely high expectation to the lay public.

Here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **Immediate Success Rate**: The immediate success rate of CPR on television (46%) does not significantly differ from real-life figures, suggesting a level of realism in this aspect.\n\n2. **Resuscitation Process**: The process of resuscitation on TV appears to follow current guidelines, indicating that the procedures shown are likely to be accurate to some extent.\n\n3. **Survival to Discharge**: Television dramas rarely show the outcome of survival to discharge, which is a critical measure of the success of CPR in real life. This omission may give viewers a skewed perception of the long-term success rates of CPR.\n\n4. **Patient Characteristics**: The average age of patients receiving CPR in TV shows is 36 years, which is significantly younger than the average age of patients who receive CPR in real life. This could be misleading, as it does not reflect the higher incidence of CPR in older populations.\n\n5. **Cause of Arrest**: The most common cause of cardiac arrest on TV is trauma, which is not reflective of real-life scenarios where cardio-respiratory causes, such as myocardial infarction, are more prevalent.\n\nIn conclusion, while some aspects of CPR portrayal on television medical dramas are realistic, others are exaggerated or misrepresentative. This could influence patients' perceptions and preferences regarding CPR, potentially leading to unrealistic expectations."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: The reuse of disposable laparoscopic instruments carries a risk of transmitting infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV. We evaluated the safety of reusing disposable trocars by studying the chances of their harboring infectious viruses after resterilization in an in vitro setting. Disposable laparoscopic trocars were exposed to horse blood contaminated with high or low viral concentrations of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) and attenuated polio virus type 1 at room temperature for 2 h. HSV1 was chosen as the surrogate for lipid viruses that include hepatitis B and HIV virus; polio virus represented the nonlipid viruses that cause infections in immunocompromised patients and are more resistant to sterilization. The trocars were subsequently cleaned and resterilized by low-temperature steam and formaldehyde at 80 degrees C for 3 h. Viral cultures were then repeated after sterilization. A cytopathic effect (CPE) was demonstrated at both concentrations for HSV1 in all trocars before but not after sterilization. For the polio virus, CPE was evident in 50% of the trocars (two of four) exposed to high viral concentration after sterilization.\nQuestion: Is it safe to reuse disposable laparoscopic trocars?", "gt": "Disposable trocars are difficult to resterilize and may harbor infectious viruses after their initial use. Therefore, the reuse of disposable trocars in laparoscopic surgery cannot be recommended.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the context provided, reusing disposable laparoscopic trocars carries a risk, especially concerning the potential transmission of infectious diseases. The study indicates that while high-temperature sterilization methods can effectively eliminate herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1), which is used as a surrogate for lipid viruses like hepatitis B and HIV, it was less effective against the polio virus, a nonlipid virus. Specifically, even after sterilization, 50% of the trocars exposed to high concentrations of polio virus still showed a cytopathic effect, indicating the presence of viable virus. This suggests that the sterilization process might not always be sufficient to ensure complete elimination of all types of viruses, particularly those more resistant to sterilization methods.\n\nTherefore, based on the findings, it cannot be conclusively stated that reusing disposable laparoscopic trocars is entirely safe, as there remains a risk of transmitting infectious agents, especially nonlipid viruses like polio virus."}

Elderly persons in communities 1-2 km (exposed) and 5 km (unexposed), from five pre-selected mine dumps in Gauteng and North West Province, in South Africa were included in a cross-sectional study. Structured interviews were conducted with 2397 elderly people, using a previously validated ATS-DLD-78 questionnaire from the British Medical Research Council. Exposed elderly persons had a significantly higher prevalence of chronic respiratory symptoms and diseases than those who were unexposed., Results from the multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that living close to mine dumps was significantly associated with asthma (OR = 1.57; 95% CI: 1.20 - 2.05), chronic bronchitis (OR = 1.74; 95 CI: 1.25 - 2.39), chronic cough (OR = 2.02; 95% CI: 1.58 - 2.57), emphysema (OR = 1.75; 95% CI: 1.11 - 2.77), pneumonia (OR = 1.38; 95% CI: 1.07 - 1.77) and wheeze (OR = 2.01; 95% CI: 1.73 - 2.54).

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: To evaluate the cumulative effect of repeated transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) on chronic osteoarthritic (OA) knee pain over a four-week treatment period, comparing it to that of placebo stimulation and exercise training given alone or in combination with TENS. Sixty-two patients, aged 50-75, were stratified according to age, gender and body mass ratio before being randomly assigned to four groups. Patients received either (1) 60 minutes of TENS, (2) 60 minutes of placebo stimulation, (3) isometric exercise training, or (4) TENS and exercise (TENS&Ex) five days a week for four weeks. Visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to measure knee pain intensity before and after each treatment session over a four-week period, and at the four-week follow-up session. Repeated measures ANOVA showed a significant cumulative reduction in the VAS scores across the four treatment sessions (session 1, 10, 20 and the follow-up) in the TENS group (45.9% by session 20, p<0.001) and the placebo group (43.3% by session 20, p = 0.034). However, linear regression of the daily recordings of the VAS indicated that the slope in the TENS group (slope = -2.415, r = 0.943) was similar to the exercise group (slope = -2.625, r = 0.935), which were steeper than the other two groups.

The NFA placed strong access restrictions on firearms. To assess the impact of legislative restrictions on the incidence of firearm suicide in Queensland and explore alternative or contributory factors behind observed declines. The Queensland suicide register (QSR) provided detailed information on all male suicides in Queensland (1990-2004), with additional data for Australia (1968-2004) accessed from other official sources. Trends in suicide rates pre/post NFA, and in method selection, were assessed using negative binomial regressions. Changing method selection patterns were examined using a cohort analysis of 5 years of age classes for Australian males. The observed reduction in firearms suicides was initiated prior to the 1997 introduction of the NFA in Queensland and Australia, with a clear decline observed in Australian figures from 1988. No significant difference was found in the rate pre/post the introduction of the NFA in Queensland; however, a significant difference was found for Australian data, the quality of which is noticeably less satisfactory. A marked age-difference in method choice was observed through a cohort analysis demonstrating both time and age influences.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Recently, a strategy for treating stroke directly at the emergency site was developed. It was based on the use of an ambulance equipped with a scanner, a point-of-care laboratory, and telemedicine capabilities (Mobile Stroke Unit). Despite demonstrating a marked reduction in the delay to thrombolysis, this strategy is criticized because of potentially unacceptable costs. We related the incremental direct costs of prehospital stroke treatment based on data of the first trial on this concept to one year direct cost savings taken from published research results. Key parameters were configuration of emergency medical service personnel, operating distance, and population density. Model parameters were varied to cover 5 different relevant emergency medical service scenarios. Additionally, the effects of operating distance and population density on benefit-cost ratios were analyzed. Benefits of the concept of prehospital stroke treatment outweighed its costs with a benefit-cost ratio of 1.96 in the baseline experimental setting. The benefit-cost ratio markedly increased with the reduction of the staff and with higher population density. Maximum benefit-cost ratios between 2.16 and 6.85 were identified at optimum operating distances in a range between 43.01 and 64.88 km (26.88 and 40.55 miles). Our model implies that in different scenarios the Mobile Stroke Unit strategy is cost-efficient starting from an operating distance of 15.98 km (9.99 miles) or from a population density of 79 inhabitants per km2 (202 inhabitants per square mile).\nQuestion: Is prehospital treatment of acute stroke too expensive?", "gt": "This study indicates that based on a one-year benefit-cost analysis that prehospital treatment of acute stroke is highly cost-effective across a wide range of possible scenarios. It is the highest when the staff size of the Mobile Stroke Unit can be reduced, for example, by the use of telemedical support from hospital experts. Although efficiency is positively related to population density, benefit-cost ratios can be greater than 1 even in rural settings.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the context provided, the prehospital treatment of acute stroke using a Mobile Stroke Unit (MSU) does not appear to be too expensive when considering its benefits. The analysis conducted shows that the benefits of this treatment approach outweigh its costs, with a benefit-cost ratio of 1.96 in the baseline experimental setting. This ratio indicates that for every unit of cost, there is nearly two units of benefit. Furthermore, the benefit-cost ratio increases with certain adjustments, such as reducing staff or operating in areas with higher population density. The model suggests that the MSU strategy can be cost-efficient under various scenarios, starting from an operating distance of about 16 km or from a population density of about 79 inhabitants per square kilometer. Therefore, the cost-effectiveness of the MSU strategy for treating stroke pre-hospital appears to be favorable, making it a potentially valuable addition to stroke treatment protocols."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: At depths below 10 m, reefs are dominated by blue-green light because seawater selectively absorbs the longer, 'red' wavelengths beyond 600 nm from the downwelling sunlight. Consequently, the visual pigments of many reef fish are matched to shorter wavelengths, which are transmitted better by water. Combining the typically poor long-wavelength sensitivity of fish eyes with the presumed lack of ambient red light, red light is currently considered irrelevant for reef fish. However, previous studies ignore the fact that several marine organisms, including deep sea fish, produce their own red luminescence and are capable of seeing it. We here report that at least 32 reef fishes from 16 genera and 5 families show pronounced red fluorescence under natural, daytime conditions at depths where downwelling red light is virtually absent. Fluorescence was confirmed by extensive spectrometry in the laboratory. In most cases peak emission was around 600 nm and fluorescence was associated with guanine crystals, which thus far were known for their light reflecting properties only. Our data indicate that red fluorescence may function in a context of intraspecific communication. Fluorescence patterns were typically associated with the eyes or the head, varying substantially even between species of the same genus. Moreover red fluorescence was particularly strong in fins that are involved in intraspecific signalling. Finally, microspectrometry in one fluorescent goby, Eviota pellucida, showed a long-wave sensitivity that overlapped with its own red fluorescence, indicating that this species is capable of seeing its own fluorescence.\nQuestion: Red fluorescence in reef fish: a novel signalling mechanism?", "gt": "We show that red fluorescence is widespread among marine fishes. Many features indicate that it is used as a private communication mechanism in small, benthic, pair- or group-living fishes. Many of these species show quite cryptic colouration in other parts of the visible spectrum. High inter-specific variation in red fluorescence and its association with structures used in intra-specific signalling further corroborate this view. Our findings challenge the notion that red light is of no importance to marine fish, calling for a reassessment of its role in fish visual ecology in subsurface marine environments.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "The study suggests that red fluorescence in reef fish could indeed serve as a novel signalling mechanism. This hypothesis is supported by several key observations:\n\n1. **Red Fluorescence Prevalence**: At least 32 reef fish species across 16 genera and 5 families exhibit pronounced red fluorescence under natural daytime conditions, even at depths where downwelling red light is virtually absent. This indicates that the fluorescence is not merely a byproduct of environmental conditions but a potentially functional trait.\n\n2. **Spectral Properties and Emission**: The fluorescence is characterized by peak emission around 600 nm, which is within the red spectrum. This wavelength is significant because it is not commonly found in the ambient light at reef depths, suggesting a specialized function.\n\n3. **Association with Guanine Crystals**: The fluorescence is associated with guanine crystals, which are known for their light-reflecting properties but here are shown to have additional light-emitting capabilities. This dual functionality of guanine crystals could be a key evolutionary adaptation for signaling.\n\n4. **Intraspecific Communication**: The patterns of fluorescence are often associated with the eyes or the head and are particularly strong in fins used for intraspecific signaling. This localization suggests that the fluorescence could be used for communication within species, possibly for mating, territorial displays, or other social interactions.\n\n5. **Visual Sensitivity Matching**: Microspectrometry in the goby *Eviota pellucida* revealed that the species has a long-wave sensitivity that overlaps with its own red fluorescence. This indicates that the fish can see its own fluorescence, supporting the hypothesis that the fluorescence serves a visual communication function.\n\nIn conclusion, the data strongly suggest that red fluorescence in reef fish may function as a novel mechanism for intraspecific communication, potentially allowing fish to signal to conspecifics in ways that are invisible to predators or competitors that cannot see red light."}

Further biopsies revealed varying degrees of VAIN and even invasive carcinoma in some cases. This suggests that vaginal cytology can identify dysplastic changes early, offering the opportunity for timely intervention and management, which may include treatments like salvage radiotherapy or the use of high-dose progestogens and topical 5-fluorouracil. Therefore, vaginal cytology can play a crucial role in the follow-up care of patients who have undergone a hysterectomy for cervical cancer."}

Data from approximately 460,000 Independence Blue Cross patients enrolled in 280 primary care practices, all converting to PCMH status between 2008 and 2012. We estimate the effect of a practice becoming PCMH-certified on ED visits and costs using a difference-in-differences approach which exploits variation in the timing of PCMH certification, employing either practice or patient fixed effects. We analyzed patients with and without chronic illness across six chronic illness categories. Among chronically ill patients, transition to PCMH status was associated with 5-8 percent reductions in ED utilization. This finding was robust to a number of specifications, including analyzing avoidable and weekend ED visits alone. The largest reductions in ED visits are concentrated among chronic patients with diabetes and hypertension.\nQuestion: Do patient-centered medical homes reduce emergency department visits?", "gt": "Adoption of the PCMH model was associated with lower ED utilization for chronically ill patients, but not for those without chronic illness.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: To study which cut off point of DAS28 corresponds to fulfilment of the American Rheumatism Association (ARA) preliminary remission criteria, and clinical remission criteria in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). All adult patients diagnosed with RA at Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 Central Hospital 1997-98 were assessed for remission at 5 years. Remission was defined as (a) ARA remission; (b) clinical remission (defined as no tender or swollen joints and normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate). DAS28 was used to measure disease activity. A receiver operating characteristics curve analysis was performed to calculate a cut off point of DAS28 that best corresponds to the ARA remission criteria and the clinical remission criteria. 161 patients (mean age 57 years, 107 (66%) female, 98 (61%) with positive rheumatoid factor, and 51 (32%) with erosions) were studied. At 5 years, 19 (12%) patients met the ARA remission criteria, and 55 (34%) met the clinical remission criteria. The cut off value of DAS28 was 2.32 for the ARA remission criteria, and 2.68 for the clinical remission criteria. In patients with DAS28<2.32, 11/57 (19%) had tender joints, 6/57 (11%) had swollen joints, and 4/57 (7%) had both tender and swollen joints (66 joint count).\nQuestion: Is DAS28 an appropriate tool to assess remission in rheumatoid arthritis?", "gt": "In this study the DAS28 cut off point for the ARA remission was lower than in previous studies.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: The Israeli National Health Insurance Law stipulates a National List of Health Services (NLHS) to which all residents are entitled from their HMOs. This list has been updated annually for almost a decade using a structured review and decision-making process. Although this process has been described in detail in previous papers, none of these have fully addressed legitimacy and fairness. We examine the legitimacy and fairness of the process of updating the NLHS in Israel. We assessed the priority-setting process for compliance with the four conditions of accountability for reasonableness outlined by Daniels and Sabin (relevance, publicity, appeals, and enforcement). These conditions emphasize transparency and stakeholder engagement in democratic deliberation. Our analysis suggests that the Israeli process for updating the NLHS does not fulfill the appeals and enforcement conditions, and only partially follows the publicity and relevance conditions, outlined in the accountability for reasonableness framework. The main obstacles for achieving these goals may relate to the large number of technologies assessed each year within a short time frame, the lack of personnel engaged in health technology assessment, and the desire for early adoption of new technologies.\nQuestion: The process of updating the National List of Health Services in Israel: is it legitimate?", "gt": "The process of updating the NLHS in Israel is unique and not without merit.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: This study evaluated the marginal quality of differently bonded direct resin composite restorations in enamel and dentin, before and after thermomechanical loading (TML). Special attention was focussed on the performance of selective enamel etching, etch-and-rinse, and self-etching adhesives. Eighty MO cavities with proximal margins beneath the cementoenamel junction were prepared in extracted human third molars. Direct resin composite restorations (Tetric EvoCeram, n=8) were placed with 4-step selective enamel etching (Syntac SE), 4-step etch-and-rinse (Syntac ER), 2-step etch-and-rinse (XP Bond, Scotchbond 1 XT/Single Bond Plus), 2-step self-etching (AdheSE, Clearfil SE Bond), 2-step self-etching with selective enamel etching (AdheSE SE, Clearfil SE Bond SE), and 2-step self-etching with etch-and-rinse (AdheSE TE, Clearfil SE Bond TE). Marginal gaps were analyzed using epoxy resin replicas under a scanning electron microscope at 200X magnification. Initially, high percentages of gap-free margins were identified for all adhesives. After TML, the results were as follows: (A) Enamel margins: When phosphoric acid was used on enamel, results were constantly higher (approximately 90%) compared with two-step self-etchin adhesives (approximately 70%; p<0.05). (B) Dentin margins: No statistical differences were found when etch-and-rinse and selective etch approaches were compared (59% to 64%; p>0.05). When self-etching adhesives were used as per manufacturers' directions, dentin margins exhibited the best marginal quality (74% to 82%; p<0.05). When self-etching adhesives were used under etch-and-rinse conditions, marginal quality in dentin was significantly reduced to 35% to 42% (p<0.05).\nQuestion: Selective enamel etching reconsidered: better than etch-and-rinse and self-etch?", "gt": "Enamel bonding was generally more effective with phosphoric-acid etching.

It is important to note that using self-etching adhesives under etch-and-rinse conditions led to a significant reduction in marginal quality for dentin (35% to 42% gap-free margins), indicating that the application method and the type of adhesive should be carefully considered based on the substrate (enamel or dentin)."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: A wish to die is common in older persons and is associated with increased mortality. Several risk factors have been identified, but the association between religiousness and a wish to die in older adults has been underexplored, and the association between death attitudes and the presence of a wish to die has not been investigated yet. The aim of this study is to explore the relationship between religiousness and death attitudes on the one hand and wish to die on the other hand, adjusting for clinical factors such as the presence of depression or somatic disorder. The sample comprised 113 older inpatients (from a psychiatric and somatic ward) with a mean age of 74 years. Psychiatric diagnoses were assessed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Disorders, and logistic regression analyses estimated the unique contribution of religiousness and death attitudes to the wish to die, controlling for socio-demographic variables, depressive disorder, and somatic symptoms. Both religiousness and death attitudes were associated with a wish to die in univariate models. Adding these variables in a multivariate logistic hierarchical model, death attitudes remained significant predictors but religiousness did not; 55% of the pseudovariance of the wish to die was explained by these variables, with an effective size of 0.89. Major depressive episode, somatic symptoms, Fear of Death, and Escape Acceptance were the most important predictors of the wish to die.\nQuestion: Are religiousness and death attitudes associated with the wish to die in older people?", "gt": "This study suggests that how older adults perceive death partly determines whether they have a wish to die.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: To determine if column agglutination technology (CAT) for titration of anti-D and anti-c concentrations produces comparable results to those obtained by continuous flow analyser (CFA). Anti-D and anti-c are the two commonest antibodies that contribute to serious haemolytic disease of the foetus and neonate (HDFN). Current practice in the UK is to monitor these antibodies by CFA quantification, which is considered more reproducible and less subjective than manual titration by tube IAT (indirect antiglobulin test). CAT is widely used in transfusion laboratory practice and provides a more objective endpoint than tube technique. Antenatal samples were (i) quantified using CFA and (ii) titrated using CAT with the reaction strength recorded by a card reader and expressed as a titre score (TS).

Preclinical students knew more than clinical students about the efficacy of hepatitis B vaccine, use of antiretroviral therapy after occupational exposure to human immunodeficiency virus, and nonvaccinated healthcare workers' risk of infection from needlestick injuries (P<.001). Students' perceived risk of occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens and attitudes toward hepatitis B vaccine did not differ, but preclinical students agreed more strongly that they should double glove for all invasive procedures with sharps (P<.001). Clinical students agreed more strongly with reporting only high-risk needlestick injuries (P=.057) and with rationalizations against using UP (P=.008).

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Potential lymphatic drainage patterns from cutaneous melanomas of the head and neck are said to be variable and frequently unpredictable. The aim of this article is to correlate the anatomic distribution of pathologically involved lymph nodes with primary melanoma sites and to compare these findings with clinically predicted patterns of metastatic spread. A prospectively documented series of 169 patients with pathologically proven metastatic melanoma was reviewed by analyzing the clinical, operative, and pathologic records. Clinically, it was predicted that melanomas of the anterior scalp, forehead, and face could metastasize to the parotid and neck levels I-III; the coronal scalp, ear, and neck to the parotid and levels I-V; the posterior scalp to occipital nodes and levels II-V; and the lower neck to levels III-V. Minimum follow up was 2 years. There were 141 therapeutic (97 comprehensive, 44 selective) and 28 elective lymphadenectomies (4 comprehensive dissections, 21 selective neck dissections, and 3 cases in which parotidectomy alone was performed). Overall, there were 112 parotidectomies, 44 of which were therapeutic and 68 elective. Pathologically positive nodes involved clinically predicted nodal groups in 156 of 169 cases (92.3%). The incidence of postauricular node involvement was only 1.5% (3 cases). No patient was initially seen with contralateral metastatic disease; however, 5 patients (2.9%) failed in the contralateral neck after therapeutic dissection. In 68% of patients, metastatic disease involved the nearest nodal group, and in 59% only a single node was involved.\nQuestion: Do nodal metastases from cutaneous melanoma of the head and neck follow a clinically predictable pattern?", "gt": "Cutaneous malignant melanomas of the head and neck metastasized to clinically predicted nodal groups in 92% of patients in this series. Postauricular and contralateral metastatic node involvement was uncommon.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the provided context, nodal metastases from cutaneous melanoma of the head and neck generally follow a clinically predictable pattern, as evidenced by the fact that pathologically positive nodes involved clinically predicted nodal groups in 156 out of 169 cases (92.3%).

Additionally, in 68% of patients, metastatic disease involved the nearest nodal group, indicating a general trend but with exceptions. Therefore, while there is a strong correlation with predicted patterns, the metastatic spread can still exhibit some unpredictability."}

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Although the apolipoprotein E genotype epsilon4 (apoE4) has been associated with high cholesterol levels, whether it is an independent predictor of coronary events is not certain. We measured apoE genotypes in 730 participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (421 men and 309 women, mean [+/- SD] age of 52+/-17 years) who were free of preexisting coronary heart disease. A proportional hazards regression model was used to study the association between risk factors and the occurrence of coronary events, defined as angina pectoris, documented myocardial infarction by history or major Q waves on the electrocardiogram (Minnesota Code 1:1 or 1:2), or coronary death, adjusted for other risk factors, including total plasma cholesterol level. The apoE4 allele was observed in 200 subjects (27%), including 183 heterozygotes and 17 homozygotes. Coronary risk factor profiles were similar in those with and without apoE4. Coronary events developed in 104 (14%) of the 730 subjects, including 77 (18%) of the 421 men during a mean follow-up of 20 years and 27 (9%) of the 309 women during a mean follow-up of 13 years. Coronary events occurred significantly more frequently in subjects with apoE4 (n = 40, 20%) than in those without this allele (64, 12%, P<0.05). In a multivariate model, apoE4 was an independent predictor of coronary events in men (risk ratio [RR]= 2.9, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.8 to 4.5, P<0.0001) but not in women (RR = 0.9, 95% CI: 0.4 to 1.9, P = 0.62).\nQuestion: Is the apoE4 allele an independent predictor of coronary events?", "gt": "The apoE4 genotype is a strong independent risk factor for coronary events in men, but not women.

The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between typical WML- and diabetes-related magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in a cohort of patients scheduled for carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Ninety-three consecutive patients (mean age 71\u00b19years; male 71) were included in a single-centre retrospective study. All the patients underwent MRI as baseline evaluation prior to CEA. A neuroradiologist blinded to the presence of risk factors calculated WML volume and number of lesions on FLAIR images using a semi-automated segmentation technique. Receiver operating characteristics analysis was performed to search for any association between WML volume and the number of WML lesions. The Mann-Whitney tests were used to determine significant WML differences between diabetic and non-diabetic patients. Logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the potential association of other variables. The prevalence of diabetes was 20.4% (n=19). WML volume and number of WML lesions were significantly associated with diabetes (P=0.001). A statistically significant difference in WML volume was found between diabetic and non-diabetic patients (P<0.0001).

Data were reviewed for patients enrolled in RECORD-1 (Renal Cell Cancer Treatment With Oral RAD001 Given Daily) at French sites. Response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival were evaluated in patients treated with a TKI-everolimus-TKI sequence. Thirty-six patients received a TKI after everolimus: sunitinib in 17 patients, sorafenib in 15, and dovitinib (TKI258) in 4. The response rate with TKI re-treatment was 8%, and the disease-control rate (response plus stable disease) was 75%. The median PFS with each component of the TKI-everolimus-TKI sequence was 10.7 months (95% CI, 1.8-28.5 months), 8.9 months (95% CI, 1.7-34.6 months), and 8.2 months (95% CI, 5.2-11.9 months), respectively.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Practice-based Internet communication allows patients to obtain health information, ask questions, and submit requests through a personalized Web site. While such online tools also bring great promise for educating patients with the goal of fostering behavior change, it is important to examine how individuals currently using such services differ from those who do not. The study used administrative information to characterize a population of patients communicating with a medical practice through the Internet during the end of 1999 and through 2000. Patient claims data generated during clinical encounters from January 1999 through May 2000 were examined to measure the relationship between patient demographics, frequency of visits, specific acute diagnoses, and specific chronic diagnoses and the use of online communication with the practice. Ten percent of patients, and 13.2% of patients 18 years or older, used the practice Web site. There were differences in use of the practice Web site by age and insurance status, but not by gender. Use of the practice Web site was similar or higher among patients having a diagnosis for a variety of acute and chronic conditions compared to those not having such a diagnosis. Patients with more clinic visits were more likely to use the Web-based service.\nQuestion: Using claims data to examine patients using practice-based Internet communication: is there a clinical digital divide?", "gt": "Patients using practice-based Internet communication and having significant health risks can be identified through the use of administrative data, presenting an opportunity to test online educational efforts to improve health.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the context provided, the use of claims data to examine patients using practice-based Internet communication reveals certain patterns that suggest the presence of a clinical digital divide. The clinical digital divide refers to disparities in the use of digital health resources among different patient groups. Here are some key findings from the study that indicate such a divide:\n\n1. **Age and Insurance Status Differences**: The study found that there were differences in the use of the practice Web site by age and insurance status. This implies that younger patients and those with certain types of insurance are more likely to use online communication tools compared to older patients or those with other insurance statuses. This could indicate barriers to access or familiarity with digital tools among older adults and certain insurance groups.\n\n2. **Gender Similarity**: However, the use of the practice Web site was not found to differ by gender, suggesting that, in this aspect, there is no significant clinical digital divide based on gender.\n\n3. **Chronic and Acute Conditions**: Interestingly, the use of the practice Web site was similar or higher among patients with a diagnosis for various acute and chronic conditions compared to those without such diagnoses. This suggests that patients with health issues may be leveraging online tools more frequently, possibly to manage their conditions better.\n\n4. **Frequency of Clinic Visits**: Patients who had more clinic visits were more likely to use the Web-based service. This could mean that individuals who are more engaged with their healthcare (i.e., those with more frequent visits) are also more likely to use digital health services.\n\nIn conclusion, while the study does not explicitly state the term \"clinical digital divide,\" the differences in the use of online communication tools based on age, insurance status, and frequency of clinic visits suggest that such a divide exists. This highlights the need for further research and targeted interventions to ensure equitable access to digital health resources across diverse patient populations."}

Standard ONS Fortisip (Nutricia Clinical Care, Wiltshire, Trowbridge, UK) and renal ONS Renilon (Nutricia Clinical Care) and Nepro (Abbott Laboratories, Ltd., Maidenhead, Berkshire, UK) were compared using single-blind taste tests and face-to-face, interviewer-administered questionnaires. This study took place in our HD unit in September 2007. There were 40 patients, including 24 males, 14 smokers, and 26 Caucasians, aged<30 years (n = 6), 31 to 50 years (n = 13), 51 to 70 years (n = 12), and>70 years (n = 9). Patients ranked ONS taste on a Likert scale (1 to 5), and compared flavor options, phosphate-binder requirements, and fluid contribution. Which factors influenced a patient's choice of ONS? Gender, smoking status, ethnicity, and age influenced patients' choices. The taste of Fortisip and Nepro was liked by 58% (n = 23), versus 28% liking Renilon (n = 11). Renilon was disliked by 35% (n = 14), Nepro was disliked by 30% (n = 12), and Fortisip was disliked by 25% (n = 10). The favorite taste was Fortisip, in 52% (n = 21). However, 21% (n = 4) who preferred the taste of renal ONS would not choose them long-term because of their limited flavor ranges. The lack of phosphate binders with Renilon was a deciding factor in 27% (n = 19/33). The low fluid contribution of renal ONS influenced the choice of 43% (n = 12/28). All factors considered, standard ONS remained most popular for patients aged>70 years. However, in all other subgroups, and particularly males and non-Caucasians, renal ONS became more popular.

The high levels of epidermal growth factor in body fluids of L-Arginine treated rats could be the explanation for this effect.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the context provided, L-Arginine appears to have a role in promoting intestinal adaptation, which may be mediated by increased levels of epidermal growth factor (EGF).

Additionally, the L-Arginine treated group had a higher weight gain and increased villus height, indicating better intestinal adaptation. These findings suggest that L-Arginine could induce intestinal adaptation, potentially through mechanisms involving increased EGF levels, which supports epithelial growth and function. However, the study does not definitively prove causation between L-Arginine and EGF-induced intestinal adaptation, only that there is a correlation. Further research would be needed to establish the exact mechanisms involved."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Patient satisfaction is an increasing area of interest due to implications of pay for performance and public reporting of results. Although scores are adjusted for patient factors, little is known about the relationship between hospital structure, postoperative outcomes, and patient satisfaction with the hospital experience. Hospitals participating in the University HealthSystem Consortium database from 2011-2012 were included. Patients were restricted to those discharged by general surgeons to isolate surgical patients. Hospital data were paired with Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) results from the Hospital Compare website. Postoperative outcomes were dichotomized based on the median for all hospitals and stratified based on surgical volume. The primary outcome of interest was high on overall patient satisfaction, whereas other HCAHPS domains were assessed as secondary outcomes. Chi square and binary logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate whether postoperative outcomes or surgical volume more significantly influenced high patient satisfaction. The study population consisted of 171 hospitals from the University HealthSystem Consortium database. High surgical volume was a more important predictor of overall patient satisfaction regardless of hospital complication (P<0.001), readmission (P<0.001), or mortality rates (P = 0.009). Volume was found to play less of a role in predicting high satisfaction on the other HCAHPS domains. Postoperative outcomes were more predictive of high satisfaction with providers, the hospital experience, and environment.\nQuestion: Patient satisfaction: does surgical volume matter?", "gt": "High surgical volume more strongly predicted overall patient satisfaction on the HCAHPS survey than postoperative outcomes, whereas volume was less predictive in other HCAHPS domains.

High surgical volume was found to be a more important predictor of overall patient satisfaction, regardless of hospital complication rates, readmission rates, or mortality rates. This indicates that hospitals with higher surgical volumes tend to have higher overall patient satisfaction scores. However, the role of surgical volume in predicting high satisfaction was less pronounced for other specific aspects of patient experience as measured by the HCAHPS domains. Postoperative outcomes were more predictive of satisfaction with specific elements such as the performance of providers, the hospital experience, and the hospital environment."}

Applied participatory approach involving community members, patients, and key-informants in the design and implementation of the research. Whereas many participants were motivated to quit, their perceptions of desire to do so were not supported by effective interventions and many attempts to quit were unsuccessful.\nQuestion: Does culture or illness change a smoker's perspective on cessation?", "gt": "Tobacco control clinics and care providers need to adopt culturally and linguistically relevant interventions to facilitate behavioral modifications and cessation in ethnic minority communities.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the context provided, both culture and illness can influence a smoker's perspective on cessation, but the context emphasizes the cultural aspect more prominently. The research highlights that while many participants within the Chinese communities in Vancouver were motivated to quit smoking, their cultural context and the lack of culturally appropriate interventions played a significant role in the effectiveness of their attempts. This implies that although the desire to quit might be present (potentially influenced by illness or health concerns), the cultural environment and the availability of culturally tailored resources are crucial factors affecting the success of smoking cessation efforts. Thus, culture appears to play a significant role in shaping the perspective and the success of cessation efforts, even when the individual's health status (illness) motivates them to quit."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Many modifications to the traditional residency model contribute to the ongoing paradigm shift in surgical education; yet, the frequency and manner by which such changes occur at various institutions is less clear. To address this issue, our study examined the variability in endoscopy and laparoscopy training, the potential impact of new requirements, and opinions of Program Directors in Surgery (PDs). A 22-item online survey was sent to 251 PDs in the United States. Appropriate parametric tests determined significance. In all, 105 (42%) PDs responded. No difference existed in response rates among university (56.2%), university-affiliated/community (30.5%), or community (13.3%) program types (p = 0.970). Surgeons alone (46.7%) conducted most endoscopy training with a trend toward multidisciplinary teams (43.8%). A combination of fellowship-trained minimally invasive surgeons and other surgeon types (66.7%) commonly provided laparoscopy training. For adequate endoscopy experience in the future, most PDs (74.3%) plan to require a formal flexible endoscopy rotation (p<0.001). For laparoscopy, PDs intend for more minimally invasive surgery (59%) as well as colon and rectal surgery (53.4%) rotations (both p<0.001). Respondents feel residents will perform diagnostic endoscopy (86.7%) and basic laparoscopy (100%) safely on graduation. Fewer PDs confirm graduates will safely practice therapeutic endoscopy (12.4%) and advanced laparoscopy (52.4%). PDs believe increased requirements for endoscopy and laparoscopy will improve procedural competency (79% and 92.4%, respectively) and strengthen the fields of surgical endoscopy and minimally invasive surgery (55.2% and 68.6%, respectively). Less believe new requirements necessitate redesign of cognitive and technical skills curricula (33.3% endoscopy, 28.6% laparoscopy; p = 0.018). A national surgical education curriculum should be a required component of resident training, according to 79% of PDs.\nQuestion: Do increased training requirements in gastrointestinal endoscopy and advanced laparoscopy necessitate a paradigm shift?", "gt": "PDs employ and may implement varied tools to meet the increased requirements in endoscopy and laparoscopy. With such variability in educational methodology, establishment of a national surgical education curriculum is very important to most PDs.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the survey results, the need for increased training requirements in gastrointestinal endoscopy and advanced laparoscopy does not universally necessitate a paradigm shift in surgical education, at least according to the Program Directors in Surgery (PDs) surveyed.

This suggests that while there is a recognition of the importance of enhancing training in these areas, the current framework may still be adaptable without a fundamental overhaul. However, the high support for a national surgical education curriculum (79% of PDs) indicates a strong preference for standardized training, which could be seen as part of a broader shift towards more structured and consistent surgical education standards."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Full thickness grafts on the nose do not always heal without problems. Partial or entire necrosis of the graft is likely to lead to less favourable cosmetic results and prolonged wound care. No consensus exists as to the use of systemic antibiotics to increase the success rate of survival of a full thickness skin graft on the nose after non-melanoma skin cancer surgery. The objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of systemic antibiotics on the survival of full thickness grafts on the nose. We performed a randomized, controlled trial in which we compared azithromycin with standard treatment in 30 patients, who underwent a full thickness graft reconstruction of a surgical defect on the nose after surgery for non-melanoma skin cancer. Percentage survival of the graft was the main outcome measure. A statistically significant difference in favour of the grafts treated with azithromycin was seen (P=0.002). Of all the variables analysed, only smoking had a significant negative effect on the survival of the graft.\nQuestion: Do systemic antibiotics increase the survival of a full thickness graft on the nose?", "gt": "Systemic antibiotics with an accurate bacterial spectrum should be advised in full thickness skin graft reconstruction after surgery for non-melanoma skin cancer of the nose.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Numerous clinical studies have shown that biofilm formation by Staphylococcus epidermidis on the outer surface of a silicone breast implant is strongly associated with capsular contracture formation. Traditional administration of systemic antibiotics and antiseptic washing are not necessarily the most effective methods for the prevention of initial biofilm formation on implants in the clinical scenario. In this study an alternative or supplement was sought for preventing or delaying bacterial colonisation and adherence to the outer surface of a breast implant, by establishing an in vitro model for investigating this complex problem. The in vitro antimicrobial activity of several antimicrobial agents was investigated for inhibitory effects on biofilm formation by S. epidermidis. The study consisted of two experiments. The first experiment consisted of two groups (A and B) of seven discs each whilst the second experiment was divided into three groups (C, D and E) of 14 discs each. Each group of 14 consisted of seven smooth and seven textured discs. Discs (biopsies) of each implant were individually coated with one of six different antimicrobial agents. Controls that received no agent were included in the various experimental groups. In the first experiment disc diffusion sensitivity testing was performed and inhibition zone sizes were measured. In the second experiment the discs were cultured in broth. The degree of biofilm formation was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In the first in vitro experiment, all six agents showed a measurable antimicrobial effect against the biofilm-forming strain of S. epidermidis when compared to the effect against the American Type Culture Collection strain. In the second in vitro experiment, discs coated with Chloramex, Fucidin and Terramycin did not allow biofilm formation to take place for at least 7 days.\nQuestion: Antimicrobial coating agents: can biofilm formation on a breast implant be prevented?", "gt": "Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilm formation on the outer surface of a silicone breast implant was prevented in vitro for at least 7 days by coating with an appropriate antimicrobial agent.

Discs coated with these agents did not allow biofilm formation to occur for at least 7 days. This suggests that these antimicrobial coatings could serve as a viable alternative or supplement to traditional methods like systemic antibiotics and antiseptic washing, which have been found to be less effective in preventing initial biofilm formation on implants.\n\nTherefore, the use of certain antimicrobial coating agents appears to have the potential to prevent or significantly delay biofilm formation on breast implants, which could help reduce the incidence of complications like capsular contracture."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Growth reference charts are usually based on measurements of children free from a medical condition that affects growth. However, samples collected during the past decades often contain a large proportion of overweight or obese children. Because obesity increases linear growth, the question arises to what extent the percentiles curves for length/height are affected by the presence of children with overweight or obesity. Data from two cross-sectional samples of 2-year-old to 18-year-old children were analysed: 12,252 Belgian children, measured in 2002-2004, and 6159 Norwegian children, measured in 2003-2006. The LMS method was used to estimate height-for-age curves with and without children considered overweight or obese according to the International Obesity Task Force thresholds. The prevalence of overweight (including obesity) and obesity was 13.0% and 2.8% in the Belgian and 13.8% and 2.3% in the Norwegian sample. Children were taller when overweight (+0.49 and 0.43 SD, in the Belgian and Norwegian sample, respectively) or obese (+0.73 and 0.72 SD in the Belgian and Norwegian sample, respectively). Effect sizes were smaller in younger and older children, which points to an advanced age of maturation as a possible cause. Excluding overweight and obese children had only a minor impact on the growth curves with largest difference in mean height SD scores -0.09 in the Belgian and -0.12 in the Norwegian sample with a corresponding increase of up to 0.5% and 1.2% in number of children>+2 SD.\nQuestion: Should children with overweight or obesity be excluded from height references?", "gt": "Current Belgian and Norwegian growth references for length/height were found to be largely unaffected by the current proportion of overweight and obese children. There is, therefore, no need for revised height charts that exclude overweight or obese children.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the information provided, the exclusion of children with overweight or obesity from height references has only a minor impact on the growth curves. The largest difference observed in mean height SD scores when overweight and obese children were excluded was -0.09 in the Belgian sample and -0.12 in the Norwegian sample. This corresponds to a relatively small increase in the number of children above +2 SD, up to 0.5% in the Belgian sample and 1.2% in the Norwegian sample.\n\nGiven these findings, the decision to exclude children with overweight or obesity from height references should be carefully considered. While these children are indeed taller on average, the impact on the overall growth curves is minimal. Therefore, excluding them might not significantly alter the reference charts but could complicate their use and interpretation, as it would not reflect the current population's growth patterns accurately, which include a considerable proportion of children with overweight or obesity.\n\nIn summary, based on the data, there is no strong argument for excluding children with overweight or obesity from height references, as the effect on the growth curves is minor. However, it is important to consider the implications of including them in terms of how these references are used in clinical and public health settings."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: DSM-IV subtypes anorexia nervosa by the presence or absence of bulimic symptoms. Assessing whether bulimic symptoms are related to the probability of recovery can provide justification for subtyping of anorexia. Two hundred twenty-five treatment-seeking women with anorexia and/or bulimia nervosa were interviewed every 3 months for up to 4 years. Survival methods were used for analyses. Less than half of the entire cohort recovered; however, the great majority of the women became less symptomatic over time. Contrary to findings from previous studies, bulimic anorexics had a higher rate of recovery than restricting anorexics.\nQuestion: Subtyping eating disorders: is it justified?", "gt": "Differences in course provide some support for the subtyping of anorexia nervosa.

This finding contradicts some previous studies but suggests that the presence of bulimic symptoms may influence recovery rates. Therefore, understanding these differences can be important for tailoring treatment approaches and improving outcomes for individuals with eating disorders. The subtyping helps in identifying distinct patterns of symptoms and behaviors that could have different prognoses and may require different therapeutic interventions."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Concerns have been raised regarding residual symptoms of caudal segment (L5-S1) degeneration that may affect clinical outcomes or require additional surgery after isolated L4-5 fusion, especially if there is pre-existing L5-S1 degeneration. This study aimed to evaluate the L5-S1 segment after minimally invasive lumbar interbody fusion at the L4-5 segment, as well as the influence of pre-existing L5-S1 degeneration on radiologic and clinical outcomes. This retrospective study evaluated patients with isthmic spondylolisthesis and degenerative spondylolisthesis who underwent mini-open anterior lumbar interbody fusion with percutaneous pedicle screw fixation (PSF) or minimally invasive transforaminal interbody fusion with PSF at the L4-5 segment. The minimum follow-up period was 7\u00a0years, and radiographic evaluations were conducted via magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and plain radiography at the 5-year follow-up. Clinical outcomes were assessed using the Visual Analog Score, Oswestry Disability Index, and surgical satisfaction rate. Patients were divided into two groups, those with and without pre-existing L5-S1 degeneration, and their final outcomes and incidence of radiographic and clinical adjacent segment disease (ASD) were compared. Among 70 patients who underwent the procedures at our institution, 12 (17.1%) were lost to follow-up. Therefore, this study evaluated 58 patients, with a mean follow-up period of 9.4\u2009\u00b1\u20092.1\u00a0years. Among these patients, 22 patients had pre-existing L5-S1 degeneration, while 36 patients did not have pre-existing L5-S1 segmental degeneration. There were no significant differences in the clinical outcomes at the final follow-up when the two groups were compared. However, radiographic ASD at L5-S1 occurred in seven patients (12.1%), clinical ASD at L5-S1 occurred in three patients (5.2%), and one patient (1.7%) required surgery. In the group with pre-existing degeneration, L5-S1 degeneration was radiographically accelerated in four patients (18.2%) and clinical ASD developed in one patient (4.5%).

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Reports from the National Wilms' Tumor Study (NWTS) Group on the subject of chest computed tomography (CT) versus chest radiograph for the detection of lung metastases from Wilms tumor are reviewed. Thirty-two patients with lung nodules detected by CT, with negative chest radiographs, were identified. Five patients were excluded from further analysis. Of the remaining 27 patients, 18 were treated as stage IV, receiving therapy with three drugs and lung irradiation; the other nine were treated with less intensive therapy and no lung irradiation. The investigators found no significant difference between the overall survival between these two groups of patients (94% and 88%, respectively). In an earlier study, four of 11 children (36%) with normal chest radiographs and positive chest CT results were treated by ignoring the CT findings. These data compared with a relapse rate of only 20% in a control population. The studies do not statistically address the question of the impact of CT of the chest on survival.\nQuestion: Current controversy: is computed tomography scan of the chest needed in patients with Wilms' tumor?", "gt": "All children should have the benefit of the most sensitive imaging available, including CT, to detect tumor spread.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "The reports from the National Wilms' Tumor Study (NWTS) Group highlight a current controversy regarding the necessity of using computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest in patients with Wilms' tumor for the detection of lung metastases.

While CT scans can detect metastases that chest radiographs might miss, the current data do not provide a clear statistical advantage in terms of survival outcomes when these additional findings are acted upon. This suggests that the routine use of CT scans for all patients with Wilms' tumor may not be necessary, but the decision should be made on a case-by-case basis, considering the potential benefits and risks of additional imaging and treatment."}

Because no previous surveys have specifically considered this aspect, we evaluated the perceived role and usefulness of guidelines, as well as barriers to and facilitators of their implementation, for hospital, primary care, and nonpracticing clinicians. A 43-item self-administered questionnaire was sent to all National Health Service physicians in the province of Modena, Italy (593 primary care physicians, 1049 hospital physicians, and 149 nonpracticing clinicians), and 1199 (66.9%) responded. Opinions and attitudes were assessed using 5-point ordinal scales and an attitude measurement scale. Results were evaluated overall and by professional setting, sex, age, year of graduation, and academic background. Practice guidelines were generally perceived to be less useful than other sources of medical information (eg, personal experience, conferences, colleagues, articles, the Internet, and textbooks [pharmaceutical representatives were the exception]). Most physicians thought that guidelines are developed for cost-containment reasons and expressed concerns about their limited applicability to individual patients and local settings. Most respondents did not favor the involvement of health professionals other than physicians in guideline development and use and preferred nonmonetary incentives for their implementation. Answers to individual items and attitude scores varied significantly across professional settings.

Season and type of locality (urban or rural) at the moment of the sting were recorded. Serum specific IgE levels to venoms from Vespula and Polistes were measured, and a primary sensitization was determined to whichever genus of wasp for which the highest class of specific IgE was observed. The primary sensitization in relation to the type of locality and the season was assessed using the chi-square test. Most reactions occurred in urban areas (67.8 %), and in the summer season (63.4 %). Most patients were sensitized to Vespula venom (94.8 %).

As such, a critical first step in understanding youth cessation is to better understand the beliefs youth have about different cessation options. This cross-sectional study used self-reported data collected from 26,379 grade 9 to 12 students in Ontario, Canada. We examined both the attitudes of youth smokers toward common smoking cessation approaches and factors associated with intentions to join a school-based cessation program. The majority of youth smokers intend to quit smoking but tend to have negative attitudes toward most formal smoking cessation approaches; Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) was an exception. Among occasional smokers, self-identification as a smoker and being physically active were positively associated with intending to join a school-based cessation program.

Ten-year follow-up study of women who had participated in a cross-sectional survey during college. In 1982, a sample of freshman and senior women at a large university in the Boston area were questioned about their weight, dieting history, bulimic symptoms, and eating patterns, attitudes, and concerns. In 1992, all subjects who responded to the 1982 survey were followed up to assess changes in bulimic symptoms and ability to recall past behaviors. Among the 476 women who responded to both surveys, the percentage in 1992 who reported having ever binged and/or purged was less than the percentage in 1982, indicating that the recall of past behaviors was less than perfect. Denial in 1992 of ever having engaged in the behaviors ranged from 22% among the women who were self-inducing vomiting in 1982 to 64% among the women who had reported current fasting or strict dieting in 1982. Recall of past behaviors in 1992 was better among the women who had been current bingers or purgers in 1982.\nQuestion: Disordered eating: can women accurately recall their binging and purging behaviors 10 years later?", "gt": "Our results demonstrate that ability to recall past binging and purging is only modest.

The bar and restaurant differ in wine sales by the glass vs. by the bottle (93\u00a0% vs. 63\u00a0% by the glass respectively). Daily wine volume purchased was 9.4\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI: 1.9, 17.5) higher when sold in larger compared to standard-sized glasses. This effect seemed principally driven by sales in the bar area (bar: 14.4\u00a0% [3.3, 26.7]; restaurant: 8.2\u00a0% [-2.5, 20.1]).

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Varicocelectomy after previous inguinal surgery poses a potential risk of testicular volume loss. To assess the extent to which varicocelectomy can be done without the complication of ipsilateral testis atrophy we present outcomes in adolescent patients with a history of inguinal surgery who underwent ipsilateral varicocelectomy. We retrospectively reviewed patient data from a single urologist practice. Testicular volume was recorded preferentially by ultrasound or, when unavailable, by ring orchidometry. Testicular asymmetry was calculated using the formula, [(right testis volume - left testis volume)/right testis volume] \u00d7 100. Symmetry was defined as less than 10% asymmetry. Catch-up growth was defined as resolution of asymmetry. We identified 22 adolescent patients who fit study criteria. The patients underwent a total of 25 varicocelectomies since 3 underwent bilateral repair after previous bilateral inguinal surgery. Initial inguinal surgery included inguinal herniorrhaphy, hydrocelectomy and orchiopexy. Varicocelectomy was done laparoscopically in 17 cases and via open technique in 8 with variations in preservation/sacrifice of the lymphatics and artery. Median \u00b1 SD followup was 24.2 \u00b1 18.2 months. After varicocelectomy mean testicular asymmetry decreased from 27.6% to 10.5%. There was no incidence of testicular atrophy postoperatively.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: It has been suggested that the use of a short-stem prosthesis could conserve proximal bone by proximal load transfer. Proximal stress shielding should be reduced, a phenomenon that has been associated with bone resorption around traditional stems. Bone remodelling of a metaphyseal fixed stem (Nanos, Smith&Nephew Int.) was analysed by the dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. This study included 36 patients undergoing the total hip replacement using the Nanos short stem in comparison to 36 patients operated by a traditional long-stemmed femoral stem (Alloclassic). In all cases a threaded cup was inserted. Both groups were not different in regard to the BMI or in regard to the quality of bone (BMI). The average age of the group of patients with the short-stem prosthesis was slightly younger (average 54.2 years [range: 29 to 75]) than the patient group with the long-stem prosthesis (average 61.1 years [range: 39 to 71]). A prospective clinical analysis was done by the Harris hip score (HHS) and the Sutherland score to evaluate the social quality of life. With a minimum follow-up of 12 months in all cases, radiological changes in regard to stem subsidence, periprosthetic osteolysis or linear radiolucencies were analysed. The changes of periprosthetic bone density were examined with DEXA in all patients 3 and 12 months postoperatively. No patients required reoperation because of loosening or subsidence of the short-stem prosthesis. The HHS improved from a mean of 43.1 (range: 9 to 51) to 96.5 points (range: 79 to 100) in the short-stem group and to 91.3 points (range: 61 to 100) in the group of patients with long-stemmed femoral component. Radiographic follow-up revealed no evidence of component loosening or migration of the short-stem. Along the greater trochanter an osteolysis of the bone structure was found in two cases. A decrease of the proximal periprosthetic bone density (Gruen zone I, -6.4%) and in zone VII (-7.2%) were measured. An increase of the BMD in the lateral inferior region (Gruen zone II, +9.7%) superior to the polished tip of the short stem was observed over a period of one year after implantation. At the polished tip of the prosthesis a significant change of bone density in zone III (+1.03%) and in zone V (+0.7%) could not be observed.\nQuestion: Is there a bone-preserving bone remodelling in short-stem prosthesis?", "gt": "The desired proximal load transfer of a short-stemmed implant in the metaphyseal region of the proximal femur could not be reached with this device.

This is indicated by a few key findings:\n\n1. **Proximal Bone Density Changes:** There was a decrease in the proximal periprosthetic bone density (Gruen zone I, -6.4%) and in zone VII (-7.2%) over a period of one year after implantation. However, this decrease is not necessarily indicative of bone loss but could be part of the bone remodelling process as the body adjusts to the new prosthesis.\n\n2. **Increase in Bone Mineral Density (BMD):** An increase in BMD was observed in the lateral inferior region (Gruen zone II, +9.7%) superior to the polished tip of the short stem. This suggests that while there might be some bone resorption in certain areas, there is also bone formation in others, which is a part of the bone remodelling process.\n\n3. **No Significant Change at the Polished Tip:** No significant change in bone density was noted at the polished tip of the prosthesis in zones III (+1.03%) and V (+0.7%). This suggests that the short-stem design might be effective in reducing stress shielding and promoting a more balanced distribution of stress around the stem, which could contribute to bone preservation.\n\n4. **Clinical Outcomes:** The Harris Hip Score (HHS) showed significant improvement in both groups, but the short-stem group had a slightly higher mean score (96.5 points) compared to the long-stem group (91.3 points). This improved clinical outcome might indirectly suggest better bone integration and preservation with the short-stem design.\n\n5. **Radiographic Follow-Up:** Radiographic follow-up revealed no evidence of component loosening or migration of the short-stem, which supports the notion that the short-stem prosthesis maintains stability without causing significant bone loss.\n\nTherefore, while the short-stem prosthesis does involve some bone remodelling, the evidence suggests that it is likely associated with bone-preserving mechanisms, particularly through the observed increases in BMD in certain regions and the absence of significant bone density loss at the polished tip of the stem."}

Attribution research demonstrates the influential role played by traits in social cognition. However, there has been little investigation into how individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) understand traits. The ability of individuals with ASD to infer traits from descriptions of behavior was investigated by asking participants to read trait-implying sentences and then to choose one of two words that best related to the sentence. In Experiment 1, individuals with ASD performed similarly to matched controls in being faster at choosing the trait in comparison to the semantic associate of one of the words in the sentence. The results from Experiments 1 and 2 provided converging evidence in suggesting that inferring traits from textual descriptions of behavior occurs with relatively little effort.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Mast cells (MCs) are multifunctional immune cells that produce a number of vasoactive or thromboactive mediators. Elevated numbers of human heart MCs are observed in the shoulder regions of coronary atherosclerotic plaques, suggesting that they play a role in plaque rupture. Cardiac MC degranulation after myocardial ischemia has been documented in animal models. Cardiac MCs are highly profibrinolytic cells and release tryptase, their specific protease, after ischemic events. Mast cell activation and release of tryptase may differentiate among patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), potentially determining the clinical course of ACS. Tryptase levels may indirectly reflect the fibrinolytic status of patients. Mast cell activation after ACS was estimated in 10 controls and 52 patients by measuring the serum levels of tryptase in the acute phase, at 2 weeks, and at 3 months after the ACS episode. Total tryptase levels were determined by using the UniCAP system and analyzed with respect to the patients' clinical types of ACS on admission (ACS with persistent ST-segment elevation on electrocardiogram or with ST-segment depression). Significant differences in serum tryptase levels between the groups were found, with higher serum tryptase concentrations in the ST-segment depression group in the acute phase, and at follow-up.\nQuestion: Tryptase levels in patients after acute coronary syndromes: the potential new marker of an unstable plaque?", "gt": "Serum tryptase concentration differences among patients with distinct types of ACS may indicate a more important role of human heart MCs in ACS with ST-segment depression pathogenesis.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, is presumed to be constitutively released in most mammalian blood vessels. In isolated rat thoracic aorta, however, hemoglobin (Hb), a nitric oxide scavenger, elicited contraction only when the vessels were precontracted with an alpha adrenergic agonist. Does vascular contraction induce endothelial NO release? Thoracic aortic rings from male Sprague-Dawley rats were prepared with or without the endothelium. Vessel rings were contracted with several distinct types of contractile agonists and NO release was probed using a Hb contraction assay in the presence and absence of nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (NAME), a NO synthase inhibitor. In vessel rings precontracted with norepinephrine, potassium chloride, arginine vasopressin, prostaglandin F(2alpha), or serotonin, Hb elicited significant additional contractions. In contrast, Hb failed to elicit significant contractions in vessel rings without the functional endothelium or vessels pretreated with NAME. The Hb mediated additional contraction was not inhibited by calmidazolium, a calmodulin antagonist, and protein kinase inhibitors staurosporine and 2,5-dihydromethylcinnamate. Intercellular gap junction inhibitor 2,3-butanedione monoxime at a low dose (<2 mM) significantly attenuated the NE/Hb mediated contractions but at a high dose (>15 mM) completely prevented both contractions. The contraction coupled NO release may be mediated through a mechanism distinct from the Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent endothelial NOS pathway.\nQuestion: Contraction coupled endothelial nitric oxide release: a new paradigm for local vascular control?", "gt": "In the isolated rat thoracic aorta, endothelial NO release may be coupled to contractile stimulus. This vascular property appears to render a unique local control mechanism independent of baroreflex and other central mechanisms.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "The study you've described suggests that vascular contraction can indeed induce endothelial nitric oxide (NO) release, which presents a new paradigm for local vascular control. This finding is significant because it indicates that NO release is not only a response to relaxation signals but can also occur in response to contraction. This mechanism could play a role in the regulation of blood flow and vascular tone, especially under conditions where the vasculature is under stress or where there is a need to counterbalance excessive constriction.\n\nThe experiments in the study show that when the thoracic aortic rings from rats are precontracted with various agonists (norepinephrine, potassium chloride, arginine vasopressin, prostaglandin F(2alpha), or serotonin), the addition of hemoglobin (Hb), which scavenges NO, leads to a significant additional contraction. This additional contraction can be attributed to the scavenging of NO that is released in response to the initial contraction, indicating that NO release is a response to the contraction itself.\n\nMoreover, the fact that this NO release is inhibited by nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (NAME), a NO synthase inhibitor, and not by calmodulin antagonists or protein kinase inhibitors, suggests that the mechanism of NO release during contraction might be distinct from the classical Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent endothelial NOS pathway. This implies that there might be alternative pathways that are activated during vascular contraction to release NO, which could be a critical mechanism for local vascular control under stress conditions.\n\nTherefore, the contraction coupled endothelial NO release could represent a novel mechanism for local vascular control, complementing the known mechanisms of NO release in response to relaxation signals."}

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Pyelectasis can be defined as mild to moderate dilatation of the urinary tract and is diagnosed by means of an ultrasound scan (0.5-2cm transverse diameter in the initial ultrasound performed after birth). There is some disagreement about whether cystography should be indicated as standard practice. The aim of this study was to establish if renal function tests are useful in determining which cases of mild to moderate dilatation of the urinary tract do not require an initial cystography. The study was conducted on 79 infants (57 males, 22 females) with pyelectasis. Seventy-three were diagnosed in utero and 6 after birth. All infants underwent at least one cystography and one desmopressin urine concentration test before one year of age. Compared to infants without vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) (n=68), infants with VUR (n=11; two with Grade I, three with Grade II, five with Grade III, two with Grade IV) showed a significantly lower (P=.006) maximum urine osmolality and a significantly higher microalbumin/creatinine ratio (P<.001) and NAG/creatinine ratio (P=.003). The negative predictive value of the first two tests was 93%. Sensitivity of the maximum urine osmolality to detect VUR was 72.7% (specificity 63.2%). Sensitivity of the microalbumin/creatinine ratio to detect VUR was 62.5% (specificity 75%). The positive probability ratio (PR) was 1.29 for the NAG/creatinine ratio, 2.03 for the maximum urine osmolality and 2.5 for the microalbumin/creatinine ratio.

These tests showed a negative predictive value of 93%, indicating that they can effectively identify infants without vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), thus potentially avoiding unnecessary cystography in those cases. However, the decision should be made on a case-by-case basis, considering the clinical judgment and the specific clinical context of each infant."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: The introduction of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring into clinical practice has defined a clinical condition called 'isolated office hypertension'. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term systolic and diastolic blood pressure changes in patients with isolated office hypertension and to identify the presence of markers capable of identifying which patients will develop sustained hypertension. All the 407 patients enrolled had a random office systolic or/and diastolic blood pressure of over 140/90mmHg and a mean daytime ambulatory blood pressure of 130/84mmHg or less. At enrollment, each patient underwent a 'baseline examination' made up of a physical evaluation, a 24h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, and a mental arithmetic test performed at the end of the 24h ambulatory monitoring. Of the 173 patients finally studied, 102 (58.9%) developed sustained hypertension with an increase in both ambulatory systolic and diastolic blood pressure. At the time of the baseline examination, the patients were divided into two groups. Group A included patients with mean ambulatory systolic and diastolic blood pressures in the first hour of 130/84mmHg or less; group B included patients with mean ambulatory systolic and diastolic pressures in the first hour of greater than 130/84mmHg. During the mental arithmetic test, the systolic and heart rate values increased significantly only in group B patients. Of the 102 patients who had become hypertensive by the time of the follow-up examination, 84 (82%) belonged to group B.\nQuestion: Isolated office hypertension: are there any markers of future blood pressure status?", "gt": "These data suggest that isolated office hypertension may indeed be a transitional state towards the development of sustained hypertension. Moreover, the mean ambulatory blood pressure value during the first hour can be considered to be a marker of a higher risk of developing sustained hypertension.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the context provided, isolated office hypertension refers to a condition where patients exhibit elevated blood pressure readings in a clinical setting but have normal blood pressure readings during ambulatory monitoring. The study aimed to identify markers that could predict which patients with isolated office hypertension would develop sustained hypertension over time.\n\nFrom the study, one notable marker identified was the blood pressure response during the initial hour of ambulatory monitoring and the mental arithmetic test. Patients in Group B, who had higher mean ambulatory systolic and diastolic blood pressures in the first hour of monitoring (greater than 130/84mmHg), showed significant increases in systolic blood pressure and heart rate during the mental arithmetic test. Notably, 84 out of 102 patients (82%) who eventually developed sustained hypertension belonged to Group B.\n\nTherefore, the study suggests that patients with higher ambulatory blood pressure readings in the first hour and a more pronounced response to stress (as indicated by the mental arithmetic test) may be at higher risk of developing sustained hypertension in the future. These factors could serve as markers to identify patients who are more likely to progress from isolated office hypertension to sustained hypertension."}

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Hepatitis E is a major health problem in developing countries including India. The incidence and mortality rate in pregnant women with fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) due to hepatitis E virus (HEV) has been reported to be significantly higher, specifically in Asian women. Pregnancy is usually associated with an altered status of sex steroid hormones and immunity. Steroid hormones directly influence the replication through their effects on viral regulatory elements. Moreover, pregnant women in Asia generally suffer from folate deficiency, which is known to cause reduced immunocompetence leading to greater risk of multiple viral infections and higher viral load. To correlate and analyze the viral load and genotypes of HEV in acute liver failure with that of acute viral hepatitis among pregnant and nonpregnant women. A total of 100 FHF and 150 acute viral hepatitis (AVH) patients (50, 75 pregnant and 50, 75 nonpregnant, respectively), were included in the study. These cases were evaluated on the basis of history, clinical examination, liver function profile, and serological test of hepatitis A, B, C, and E using commercially available ELISA kits. Quantification of HEV RNA-positive samples was carried out. Out of 100 FHF and 150 acute viral hepatitis (AVH) patients, 28 (56%) and 22 (29.3%) pregnant and 7 (14%) and 8 (16%) nonpregnant, respectively, were HEV RNA-positive. HEV viral load in FHF pregnant women was 5.87 x 10(4)+/- 1.5 x 10(5) microL/mL as compared to AVH pregnant women 343.29 +/- 216.44 microL/mL and FHF and AVH nonpregnant 199.2 +/- 225.5 microL/mL and 13.83 +/- 7.8 microL/mL, respectively. Sequencing data of all the positive samples of FHF and AVH pregnant and nonpregnant women showed genotype 1.\nQuestion: Does hepatitis E viral load and genotypes influence the final outcome of acute liver failure during pregnancy?", "gt": "HEV viral load was found to be significantly higher (P<0.05) in pregnant patients compared to the nonpregnant. Pregnancy appears to be a risk factor for viral replication. The viral copies of HEV in FHF pregnant women were comparatively higher when compared to AVH pregnant women, which may be related to the severity of the disease in these patients. We could detect only one genotype (genotype 1) in our study population. Thus in the absence of other genotypes in this population, the impact of genotype could not be adequately assessed in this study.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the provided context, hepatitis E viral load appears to have a significant influence on the final outcome of acute liver failure during pregnancy. The data shows that the viral load of HEV in pregnant women with fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) is notably higher compared to those with acute viral hepatitis (AVH) and nonpregnant women. Specifically, the viral load for FHF pregnant women was 5.87 x 10^4 \u00b1 1.5 x 10^5 microL/mL, which is substantially higher than the viral load for AVH pregnant women (343.29 \u00b1 216.44 microL/mL) and both FHF and AVH nonpregnant women (199.2 \u00b1 225.5 microL/mL and 13.83 \u00b1 7.8 microL/mL, respectively).\n\nRegarding genotypes, the study found that all the positive samples from both FHF and AVH pregnant and nonpregnant women belonged to genotype 1. However, the context does not provide explicit information that links the genotype directly to the outcome of acute liver failure during pregnancy. It indicates that genotype 1 was present in all cases but does not specify if this genotype is more virulent or if it has a direct impact on the severity of the disease in pregnant women compared to other genotypes or nonpregnant women.\n\nTherefore, while the viral load is clearly higher in pregnant women with FHF, suggesting a potential correlation with the severity of the outcome, the genotype information alone does not provide a definitive link to the final outcome of acute liver failure during pregnancy. Further research would be necessary to determine if genotype 1 specifically influences the outcome or if other factors, such as the altered immune status and folate deficiency in pregnant women, play a more significant role in the severity of HEV-induced liver failure."}

We investigated the effects of H. pylori eradication on the healing of NSAID-associated bleeding peptic ulcers. Chronic NSAID users presenting with peptic ulcer haemorrhage underwent endoscopy to secure haemostasis and to document H. pylori infection by rapid urease test and culture. They were prospectively randomized to receive either omeprazole (20 mg once daily) for 8 weeks or a 1-week course of triple therapy (bismuth subcitrate 120 mg, tetracycline 500 mg, metronidazole 400 mg, all given four times daily) plus omeprazole (20 mg once daily) for 8 weeks. Endoscopy was repeated after 8 weeks. Final H. pylori status was determined by a 13C-urea breath test that was performed at least 4 weeks after discontinuation of omeprazole. 195 H. pylori-infected NSAID users, complicated by bleeding ulcers, were randomized to receive omeprazole alone (102) or triple therapy plus omeprazole (93). 174 patients returned for second endoscopy at 8 weeks (91 in the omeprazole group, 83 in the triple therapy group). Urea breath test was negative in 14% in the omeprazole group vs. 92% in the triple therapy group (P<0.001). Complete ulcer healing was achieved in 88 (97%) patients in the omeprazole group and 77 (93%) in the triple therapy group (P=0. 31).

We enrolled 121 patients for whom diagnostic coronary angiography were planned. The risk score for CI-AKI was calculated and serum creatinine (sCr) and CyC were measured before and 48 h post coronary angiography. CyC and sCr based AKI was calculated as a 25% increase from baseline within 48 h from contrast media exposure. Mean serum CyC and creatinine concentrations were 0.88 \u00b1 0.27 mg/dL and 0.79 \u00b1 0.22 mg/dL, respectively before the procedure and 1.07 \u00b1 0.47 mg/dL and 0.89 \u00b1 0.36 mg/dL, respectively 48 h after contrast media exposure (P<0.001). CyC based AKI occurred in 45 patients (37.19 %) and sCr based AKI occurred in 20 patients (16.52%) after the procedure.

Inverse social gradients existed in incident coronary morbidity and mortality. South Asian participants also had higher rates than white participants. After adjustment for clinical need, social position showed no association with the use of cardiac procedures or secondary prevention drugs. For example, men in the low versus high employment grade had an age adjusted odds ratio for angiography of 1.87 (95% confidence interval 1.32 to 2.64), which decreased to 1.27 (0.83 to 1.94) on adjustment for clinical need.

Personality was assessed through a semistructured interview with a close relative using the Personality Assessment Schedule. A wide neuropsychological battery was applied, including attentional, executive, memory tasks and global cognition. Assessments took place when symptomatology was in remission. Higher scores on a passive-dependent dimension were significantly associated with poorer memory performance.

Event-related potentials (ERPs) are a form of noninvasive neuroimaging that provide direct measurements of cortical activity and have shown value in predicting long-term cognitive functioning. The current study used ERPs to examine auditory processing in infants with SSC to help clarify the developmental onset of delays in this population. Fifteen infants with untreated SSC and 23 typically developing controls were evaluated. ERPs were recorded during the presentation of speech sounds. Analyses focused on the P150 and N450 components of auditory processing. Infants with SSC demonstrated attenuated P150 amplitudes relative to typically developing controls.

Seventeen patients, with a mean age of 44 years (range 26-72), were hospitalized for hepatic hemangioma, 8 (47%) of them were operated on and 9 (53%) were managed by observation. The operated patients presented various symptoms. One patient was operated on for traumatic rupture of the hemangioma. Non-operated patients were asymptomatic or with slight dyspeptic symptoms not related with the tumor. The first diagnostic radiological examination was ultrasonography (US) in all cases. All lesions were larger than 4cm. The types of surgical procedures were 5 enucleations, and 3 hepatic resections.

The resemblance of the metabolic syndrome and hyperuricemia has led to the suggestion that hyperuricemia is a part of the metabolic syndrome. The purpose of this study is to examine the contribution of uric acid (UA) as an additional component of the metabolic syndrome in middle-aged men. In total, 393 male participants, aged 45-60 years, were recruited from a professional health evaluation program. Anthropometric measurements and blood pressure (BP) were taken after an overnight fast. Fasting blood samples were collected for the measurements of glucose, UA, and lipid profile. Logistic regression models were fitted to examine the relationship between UA and the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome. Factor analysis was performed to explore the relationship between UA and the components of the metabolic syndrome. The diagnosis of the metabolic syndrome was significantly associated with waist circumference (WC), glucose, triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), systolic BP, and liver enzyme levels, but not associated with UA levels. The sensitivity of hyperuricemia (serum UA>or = 7.0 mg/dL) for the diagnosis of the metabolic syndrome was 58.0% and the specificity was 55.3%. In factor analysis, UA aggregated with body mass index, WC, glucose, log TG, and HDL-C as a metabolic factor. Systolic and diastolic BP were loaded on a second factor separately. The model loaded with UA explained a similar proportion of the total variance (56.9%), as did the model loaded without UA (62.5%).\nQuestion: Is hyperuricemia another facet of the metabolic syndrome?", "gt": "Our results suggest that the contribution of UA as an additional component of the syndrome seems to be insignificant. We propose that hyperuricemia might not be an important facet for the understanding of the underlying structure of the metabolic syndrome.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the provided context, hyperuricemia does not appear to be an independent or essential facet of the metabolic syndrome. While the study did find that uric acid (UA) aggregated with other metabolic syndrome components such as body mass index, waist circumference, glucose, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in factor analysis, indicating some relationship, the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome itself was not significantly associated with UA levels. Additionally, the sensitivity and specificity of hyperuricemia (defined as serum UA \u2265 7.0 mg/dL) for diagnosing metabolic syndrome were relatively low at 58.0% and 55.3%, respectively. Furthermore, the inclusion or exclusion of UA in the factor analysis models did not significantly alter the explained proportion of total variance. These findings suggest that while there may be some association between hyperuricemia and metabolic syndrome, hyperuricemia is not a definitive or necessary component of the metabolic syndrome."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: A clinical and experimental assessment using human samples of lumbar ligamentum flavum (LF). To identify platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) expression in hypertrophied LF of patients with lumbar spinal canal stenosis (LSS) and relate it to fibrosis. Recent studies showed that fibrosis in LF hypertrophy was due to accumulation of inflammation-related scar tissue. PDGF-BB participates in scar formation and collagen development in wound healing and fibrosis diseases. However, it is unclear whether PDGF-BB expression is associated with fibrosis of the hypertrophied LF in LSS. In all, 10 patients of LSS was enrolled in this study, while 10 patients of lumbar disc herniation (LDH) as a control group. LF thickness was measured by axial T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Fibrosis was graded and type of collagen was identified. The location and the expression of PDGF-BB were analyzed using immunohistochemical stains, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and Western Blotting. Correlation among LF thickness, fibrosis, and PDGF-BB expression was analyzed. LF thickness was 5.3 \u00b1 1.0 mm (range from 3.9 to 7.5 mm) in the LSS group and 2.8 \u00b1 0.7 mm (range from 1.69 to 3.8 mm) in the LDH group. Obvious fibrosis was observed in all samples of the LSS group, and correlated to LF thickness of the dural, middle, and dorsal layers (P<0.05), respectively. PDGF-BB was detected in the hypertrophied LF, particularly in the dorsal layer. PDGF-BB expression was higher in the LSS group than that in the LDH group (P<0.05), and in the dorsal layer than the dural layer in the LSS group (P<0.05). PDGF-BB mRNA correlated significantly to thickness of LF (r = 0.41) and the severity of fibrosis (r = 0.69) (P<0.05).\nQuestion: Is platelet-derived growth factor-BB expression proportional to fibrosis in the hypertrophied lumber ligamentum flavum?", "gt": "A higher PDGF-BB expression existed in the hypertrophied LF of patients with LSS and could be a risk factor of the fibrosis.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the context provided, platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) expression appears to be proportional to fibrosis in the hypertrophied lumbar ligamentum flavum (LF). The study found a significant correlation between PDGF-BB mRNA expression and the severity of fibrosis (r = 0.69, P<0.05). This suggests that as fibrosis increases in the hypertrophied LF of patients with lumbar spinal canal stenosis (LSS), the expression of PDGF-BB also increases. Therefore, PDGF-BB expression is proportionally associated with the degree of fibrosis in the LF."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Adherence to statin therapy has been shown to be suboptimal. In statin-treated patients with residual elevated low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels the physician must decide whether to switch to a more potent statin or try and achieve better adherence. We examined the association between adherence and LDL-C within low, moderate and high intensity statin groups in a \"real world\" setting. We assessed annual adherence by the mean MPR (Medication Possession Ratio = number of purchased/prescribed daily doses) in unselected patient group. Statins were stratified (ACC/AHA Guideline) into low, moderate and high intensity groups. The impact of adherence on LDL levels was assessed by LOESS (locally weighted scatter plot smoothing). Out of 1183 patients 173 (14.6%) were treated with low, 923 (78.0%) with moderate and 87 (7.4%) with high intensity statins. Statin intensity was inversely associated with adherence (MPR 77\u00b121, 73\u00b122 and 69\u00b121% for low, moderate and high intensity respectively, p=0.018). Non-adjusted LDL levels decreased with higher adherence: a 10% adherence increase resulted in LDL decrease of 3.5, 5.8 and 7.1mg/dL in low, moderate and high intensity groups. Analysis of the adherence effect on LDL levels adjusted for age, DM and ischemic heart disease showed that MPR above 80% was associated with an additional decrease in LDL levels only in the high intensity group.\nQuestion: Statin adherence and LDL cholesterol levels. Should we assess adherence prior to statin upgrade?", "gt": "Increased adherence to statins beyond an MPR of 80% improves LDL levels only among patients given high intensity therapy. Switching from lower to higher intensity therapy may be more effective than further efforts to increase adherence.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the context provided, assessing adherence prior to considering an upgrade in statin therapy is a prudent approach. The study suggests that adherence to statin therapy is inversely associated with the intensity of the statin, meaning patients on higher intensity statins tend to have lower adherence rates. Furthermore, the analysis indicates that there is a direct relationship between adherence and LDL cholesterol levels across all statin intensity groups. Specifically, a 10% increase in adherence was associated with a decrease in LDL levels, with the magnitude of this effect being more pronounced in higher intensity statin groups.\n\nThe adjusted analysis showed that an MPR (Medication Possession Ratio) above 80% was linked to an additional decrease in LDL levels, but this was only significant in the high-intensity statin group. This finding implies that improving adherence could potentially achieve the desired LDL reduction without necessarily requiring an upgrade to a more potent statin.\n\nTherefore, before deciding to switch to a more potent statin, healthcare providers should evaluate a patient's adherence to the current statin regimen. Enhancing adherence may be a viable strategy to achieve better LDL control, especially considering the potential for increased side effects and costs associated with higher intensity statins."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Although posterior wall of left atrium (LA) is known to be arrhythmogenic focus, little is known about the effect of posterior wall isolation (PWI) in patients who undergo radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) for persistent atrial fibrillation (PeAF). We randomly assigned 120 consecutive PeAF patients to additional PWI [PWI (+), n=60] or control [PWI (-), n=60]groups. In all patients, linear ablation was performed after circumferential pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). Linear lesions included roof, anterior perimitral, and cavotricuspid isthmus lines with conduction block. In PWI (+) group, posterior inferior linear lesion was also conducted. Creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) and troponin-T levels were measured 1day after RFCA. LA emptying fraction (LAEF) was assessed before and 12 months after RFCA. A total of 120 subjects were followed for 12 months after RFCA. There were no significant differences between two groups in baseline demographics and LA volume (LAV). The levels of CK-MB and troponin-T and procedure time were not significantly different between the groups. AF termination during RFCA was more frequently observed in PWI (+) than control (P=0.035). During follow-up period, recurrence occurred in 10 (16.7%) patients in PWI (+) and 22 (36.7%) in control (P=0.02). The change in LAEF was not significantly different between the groups.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: To determine whether preoperative helical CT angiography (CTA) with three-dimensional (3D) reconstructed images improves outcome in patients with ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) by identifying crossing vessels that may lead to surgical failure. Twenty-five patients with UPJO underwent imaging with CTA to identify crossing vessels. Patients with crossing vessels or severe hydronephrosis underwent laparoscopic dismembered pyeloplasty. In the absence of crossing vessels, and with>25% renal function on MAG-3 scan, the patient underwent an endopyelotomy. Procedures were assessed as successful by resolution of patient symptoms as well as relief of obstruction on renal scintography. Twenty-seven procedures (14 laparoscopic dismembered pyeloplasties [9 in the setting of a crossing vessel], 11 ureteroscopic endopyelotomies, and two antegrade endopyelotomy procedures) were performed. Follow-up ranged from 2.4 to 40 months (mean 21.6 months). Twenty-three of the primary procedures (92.0%) were successful. Primary laparoscopic pyeloplasty was successful in 100% of patients, while primary endopyelotomy had a success rate of 83.3%. Both secondary procedures were successful rendering the patients unobstructed and pain free. No complications occurred.

The overall success of the treatment modality selection based on CTA findings, however, suggests that it does contribute to better patient outcomes."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) in differentiating angiomyolipoma without visible fat from renal cell carcinoma (RCC) on MDCT. The study included 406 patients who had 47 angiomyolipomas without visible fat and 359 RCCs smaller than 4 cm, all of which were diagnosed on the basis of findings from nephrectomy or percutaneous biopsy performed at our institution between 2000 and 2011. MDCT (slice thickness, 2.5 mm for corticomedullary phase image or 5 mm for the other phase images) and clinical findings were blindly reviewed by two radiologists in a single session. At the time the study was performed, radiologist 1 had 8 years of experience, and radiologist 2 had 18 years of experience. On the basis of the MDCT and clinical findings, CADx classified renal tumors as angiomyolipoma and RCC, and each radiologist independently recorded the probability score (0-5) for angiomyolipoma. The accuracy of CADx versus radiologists in diagnosing angiomyolipoma was compared using ROC analysis. Interobserver agreement between the two radiologists was evaluated. CADx yielded an area under the curve (Az) value of 0.949, which was greater than the Az values yielded by radiologists 1 and 2 (0.872 and 0.782, respectively; p<0.05). In addition, the Az value for radiologist 1 was greater than that for radiologist 2 (p = 0.01). CADx with a threshold of -1.0085 showed greater sensitivity than radiologist 1 and greater sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy than radiologist 2 (p<0.05).

Between 1995 and 2002, 136 Hispanic men and 315 white men underwent radical prostatectomy. Treatment failure was defined as having a prostate specific antigen (PSA) of 0.2 or greater more than 8 weeks after surgery or receiving any adjuvant therapy. Known predictors of failure and race were evaluated for their ability to predict treatment failure. Median followup was 32 months for Hispanic and 36 months for white patients. Hispanic men were older, had a higher percentage of abnormal rectal examinations, Gleason 7 tumors and preoperative PSA levels greater than 10. Preoperative PSA, specimen Gleason score, pathological stage and surgical margin were all strongly associated with treatment failure (p<0.001). Despite differences in clinical characteristics, overall failure rates did not differ between Hispanic and white men (18.7% vs 17.8%).

Here are the key points:\n\n1. **Bearing Fractures:** No ceramic fractures were reported among the 94 hips analyzed at the 5-year follow-up, which suggests that AMC bearings may reduce the risk of bearing fractures compared to traditional ceramic-on-ceramic bearings.\n\n2. **Hip Noises:** The context mentions that four patients developed bearing-related complications, including three with clicking. However, there are no reports of squeaking, grinding, or popping, which are other forms of noise. This implies that while not all noise is eliminated, AMC bearings may reduce the occurrence of certain types of noise.\n\nIn summary, the use of AMC bearings appears to contribute to a decrease in ceramic fractures and may also reduce the occurrence of some types of hip noises, such as squeaking, grinding, and popping, at least in the short to intermediate term (5 years). However, clicking was still observed, indicating that not all noise issues are eliminated."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Venous thromboembolism is a common source of morbidity and mortality but a variety of preventative measures are available. To audit the current practice of thromboprophylaxis and compare against published protocols. Three-hundred and seventy-six (376) surgical patients were surveyed prospectively. A Performa was completed recording the presence of up to 11 risk factors. A risk score was calculated and the use of specific thromboprophylatic measures identified. Heparin thromboprophylaxis was widely used, eight patients (who were on aspirin therapy) failed to receive any prophylaxis (risk factors 4-6). In addition there were 60 patients at low risk (risk score<2) received LMWH from which they were unlikely to benefit.\nQuestion: Risk-based evaluation of thromboprophylaxis among surgical inpatients: are low risk patients treated unnecessarily?", "gt": "Thromboembolic prophylaxis is widely but unselectively applied. Adoption of a risk: benefit ratio approach should ensure those who would benefit from thromboprophylaxis are adequately treated while those in whom thromboprophylaxis is not indicated are spared unnecessary therapy.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the context provided, it appears that low-risk patients might indeed be receiving thromboprophylaxis unnecessarily. Specifically, out of the 376 surgical patients surveyed, 60 patients were categorized as low risk (with a risk score <2) but were still administered Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH). This suggests that these patients may not have benefited from the prophylaxis, as their risk of venous thromboembolism was already considered low. The practice of administering prophylaxis to low-risk patients could be seen as potentially unnecessary, especially considering the potential for side effects and the cost implications of such treatments. Therefore, the risk-based evaluation indicates a need for more precise adherence to protocols that target prophylaxis to those with higher risk scores to optimize patient care and resource utilization."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: There is accumulating evidence that greater availability of green space in a neighbourhood is associated with health benefits for the local population. One mechanism proposed for this association is that green space provides a venue for, and therefore encourages, physical activity. It has also been suggested that socio-economic health inequalities may be narrower in greener areas because of the equalised opportunity for physical activity green spaces provide. However, research exploring associations between the availability of green space and physical activity has produced mixed results. Limits to the assessment of the type and amount of physical activity which occurs specifically in green space may account for these mixed findings. This observational study was therefore concerned with the extent to which green space is a venue for physical activity and whether this could account for narrower socio-economic health inequalities in greener neighbourhoods. Secondary analysis of cross sectional data on 3679 adults (16+) living in urban areas across Scotland matched with a neighbourhood level measure of green space availability. Associations between green space availability and both total physical activity, and activity specifically within green space, were explored using logistic regression models. Interactions between socio-economic position and physical activity were assessed. All models adjusted for age, sex and household income. The availability of green space in a neighbourhood was not associated with total physical activity or that specifically in green space. There was no evidence that income-related inequalities in physical activity within green space were narrower in greener areas of Scotland.\nQuestion: Is level of neighbourhood green space associated with physical activity in green space?", "gt": "Physical activity may not be the main mechanism explaining the association between green space and health in Scotland.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Central venous catheter (CVC)-related infections are a substantial problem in the intensive care unit (ICU). Our infection control team initiated the routine use of antiseptic-coated (chlorhexidine-silver sulfadiazine; Chx-SS) CVCs in our adult ICUs to reduce catheter-associated (CA) and catheter-related (CR) blood stream infection (BSI) as we implemented other educational and best practice standardization strategies. Prior randomized studies documented that the use of Chx-SS catheters reduces microbial colonization of the catheter compared with an uncoated standard (Std) CVC but does not reduce CR-BSI. We therefore implemented the routine use of uncoated Std CVCs in our surgical ICU (SICU) and examined the impact of this change. The use of uncoated Std CVCs does not increase CR-BSI rate in an SICU. Prospective evaluation of universal use of uncoated Std CVCs, implemented November 2007 in the SICU. The incidences of CA-BSI and CR-BSI were compared during November 2006-October 2007 (universal use of Chx-SS CVCs) and November 2007-October 2008 (universal use of Std CVCs) by t-test. The definitions of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were used for CA-BSI and CR-BSI. Patient data were collected via a dedicated Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III coordinator for the SICU. Annual use of CVCs increased significantly in the last six years, from 3,543 (2001) to 5,799 (2006) total days. The APACHE III scores on day 1 increased from a mean of 54.4 in 2004 to 55.6 in 2008 (p\u2009=\u20090.0010; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.29-5.13). The mean age of the patients was unchanged over this period, ranging from 58.2 to 59.6 years. The Chx-SS catheters were implemented in the SICU in 2002. Data regarding the specific incidence of CR-BSI were collected beginning at the end of 2005, with mandatory catheter tip cultures when CVCs were removed. Little difference was identified in the incidence of BSI between the interval with universal Chx-SS use and that with Std CVC use. (Total BSI 0.7 vs. 0.8 per 1,000 catheter days; CA-BSI 0.5 vs. 0.8 per 1,000 catheter days; CR-BSI 0.2 vs. 0 per 1,000 catheter days.)

The study found that the implementation of uncoated Std CVCs did not increase the CR-BSI rate in the SICU.\n\nThis finding implies that, despite the initial expectation that antiseptic-coated catheters would reduce the incidence of both catheter-associated (CA) and catheter-related (CR) bloodstream infections, the actual impact on CR-BSI rates was minimal. The data showed no significant difference in the incidence of CR-BSI between the periods when Chx-SS catheters were used and when uncoated Std CVCs were used. This suggests that the additional cost and potential complications associated with antiseptic-coated catheters may not be justified if they do not significantly reduce CR-BSI rates.\n\nTherefore, the context supports a return to \"basics\" in the prevention of CR-BSIs, emphasizing that strict adherence to infection control practices and a focus on proper catheter insertion and maintenance techniques may be as effective as using antiseptic-coated catheters in reducing CR-BSIs. This approach aligns with the broader strategy of incorporating educational and best practice standardization to manage catheter-related infections in the ICU setting."}

No treatment-related deaths occurred and no patients experienced any acute grade 4 non-hematologic toxicities. Patients treated with CCRT developed more severe acute toxicities than patients who received RT alone. The 3-year overall survival (OS) rate was 36.1% for CCRT compared with 28.5% following RT alone (p\u200a=\u200a0.008). Multivariate analysis identified T stage and treatment modality as independent prognostic factors for survival. Further analysis revealed that survival was significantly better in the CCRT group than in the RT alone group for patients \u2264 72 years.

Newer generation TKIs were initiated at a\u00a0\u2265 50% dose reduction from the standard pretransplantation dosing to limit the toxicities and avoid therapy interruptions. TKIs were started a median of 100 days (range, 28-238 days) after transplantation and were administered for a median of 16 months (range, 8 days to 105 months). Eight patients discontinued therapy because of adverse events. With a median follow-up of 3.6 years (range, 4 months to 8.7 years), the 5-year relapse-free survival rate was 61%.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Treatment delay, or the time lapse between diagnosis and surgery, may have a detrimental effect on cancer outcomes. This study assesses the effect of treatment delay on cancer-related outcomes in a large, continuous series of surgically\u00a0treated colon cancer patients. All surgical colon cancer cases at our center from 2004 through 2011 were reviewed. Patients who underwent preoperative chemotherapy, emergency admissions, palliative cases, and incidental and postoperative diagnoses were excluded. Treatment delay was correlated with outcomes in univariate and multivariate regression and proportional hazards models. In 769 included patients, for every treatment-delay quartile increase, odds of death decreased by an odds ratio (OR) of 0.78 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001), and metastatic recurrence by OR 0.78 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.013).

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: To study the influence of continuous administration of heparin on platelet function in intensive care patients. Prospective, serial investigation. Clinical investigation on a surgical and neurosurgical intensive care unit in a university hospital. The study included 45 patients: 15 postoperative with patients sepsis (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score between 15 and 25), 15 trauma patients (Injury Severity Score 15 to 25), and 15 neurosurgical patients. Management of the patients was carried out according to the guidelines for modern intensive care therapy. Sepsis and trauma patients received standard (unfractionated) heparin continuously [aim: an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) approximately 2.0 times normal value; sepsis-heparin and trauma-heparin patients], whereas neurosurgical patients received no heparin (neurosurgical patients). From arterial blood samples, platelet aggregation was measured by the turbidimetric method. Platelet aggregation was induced by adenosine diphosphate (ADP; 2.0 mumol/l), collagen (10 micrograms/ml), and epinephrine (25 mumol/l). Measurements were carried out on the day of diagnosis of sepsis or 12 h after hemodynamic stabilization (trauma and neurosurgery patients) (baseline) and during the next 5 days at 12.00 noon. Standard coagulation parameters [platelet count and fibrinogen and antithrombin III (AT III) plasma concentrations] were also monitored. Heparin 4-10 U/kg per h (mean dose: approximately 500 U/h) was necessary to reach an aPTT of about 2.0 times normal. Platelet count was highest in the neurosurgical patients, but it did not decrease after heparin administration to the trauma and sepsis patients. AT III and fibrinogen plasma levels were similar in the three groups of patients. In the sepsis group, platelet aggregation variables decreased significantly (e.g., epinephrine-induced maximum platelet aggregation:-45 relative % from baseline value). Platelet function recovered during the study and even exceeded baseline values (e.g., ADP-induced maximum platelet aggregation: +42.5 relative % from baseline value). Continuous heparinization did not blunt this increase of platelet aggregation variables.

The aim of our investigation was to examine the role of renal anaemia in oxidative stress in HD patients. MDA and 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) were measured in three groups of patients undergoing HD: group I comprised eight patients with a blood haemoglobin (Hb)<10 g/dl (mean Hb = 8.1+/-1.3 g/dl), and group II were eight patients with a Hb>10 g/dl (mean Hb=12.4+/-1.9g/dl); none of these 16 patients had been treated with human recombinant erythropoietin (rHuEpo). Group III comprised 27 patients with a mean Hb of 10.5+/-1.6 g/dl after long-term rHuEpo treatment. Mean plasma concentrations of both MDA and HNE were significantly higher (P<0.0001) in all 43 HD patients than in 20 healthy controls (MDA 2.85+/-0.25 vs 0.37+/-0.03 microM, HNE 0.32+/-0.03 vs 0.10+/-0.01 microM).

This suggests that treating anaemia with rHuEpo may help reduce oxidative stress, as indicated by the lower levels of oxidative markers in the plasma of these patients. The inverse correlation between the plasma concentration of LPO products and haemoglobin levels further supports the notion that improving anaemia status can mitigate oxidative stress in haemodialysis patients."}

The goal of this investigation was to determine if ovarian secretory capacity is dependent on relative FSH levels and if basal measures of ovarian reserve reflect ovarian secretory capacity. We administered equivalent low, but effective doses of recombinant FSH for 5 days to a group of older subjects (40-45 years, n=9) and younger controls (20-25 years, n=10) after pituitary suppression with a GnRH agonist. Outcome measures included follicular development as determined by serial transvaginal ultrasound examinations and serum levels of estradiol, inhibin A and inhibin B. Serum levels of estradiol and inhibin A were not statistically different between the two groups, while the number of large follicles formed was greater in the younger subjects.

PLTC, red blood cells (RBC), haemoglobin (Hb), fibrinogen, and D-dimers were assessed in patients on admission and at discharge after major joint surgery. Functional outcomes were ascertained using the Barthel Scale (BS), the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) and gait evaluation. Thrombocytosis was considered to have occurred when PLTC was greater than or equal to 500 \u00d7 100(9)/L. All subjects with thrombocytosis had ultrasonography to assess DVT occurrence.

Mood and psychotic disorders significantly increased hospital rates in multivariate analyses which controlled for demographic characteristics, site, and danger when relevant. The model with the best fit included both diagnosis and danger.\nQuestion: Is diagnosis relevant in the hospitalization of potentially dangerous children and adolescents?", "gt": "Decisions should be linked to verifiable ratings of need and attention to danger, and its measurement should complement the current focus on diagnosis.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the context provided, diagnosis does appear to be relevant in the hospitalization of potentially dangerous children and adolescents. The study indicates that both mood and psychotic disorders significantly increased hospitalization rates even after controlling for demographic characteristics, location, and danger levels. This suggests that the type of psychiatric diagnosis is a significant factor in clinical decisions regarding hospitalization, alongside the level of danger posed by the individual. The model that best fit the data included both diagnosis and danger, further emphasizing the importance of diagnosis in the clinical evaluation process for hospitalization."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Both the material and geometry of a total knee arthroplasty (TKA) component influence the induced periprosthetic bone strain field. Strain, a measure of the local relative deformation in a structure, corresponds to the mechanical stimulus that governs bone remodeling and is therefore a useful in vitro biomechanical measure for assessing the response of bone to new implant designs and materials. A polyetheretherketone (PEEK) femoral implant has the potential to promote bone strains closer to that of natural bone as a result of its low elastic modulus compared with cobalt-chromium (CoCr).QUESTIONS/ In the present study, we used a Digital Image Correlation (DIC) technique to answer the following question: Does a PEEK TKA femoral component induce a more physiologically normal bone strain distribution than a CoCr component? To achieve this, a DIC test protocol was developed for periprosthetic bone strain assessment using an analog model; the protocol aimed to minimize errors in strain assessment through the selection of appropriate analysis parameters. Three synthetic bone femurs were used in this experiment. One was implanted with a CoCr femoral component and one with a PEEK femoral component. The third (unimplanted) femur was intact and used as the physiological reference (control) model. All models were subjected to standing loads on\u00a0the corresponding polyethylene (ultrahigh-molecular-weight polyethylene) tibial component,\u00a0and speckle image data were acquired for surface strain analysis using DIC in six repeat tests. The strain in 16 regions of interest on the lateral surface of each of the implanted bone models was plotted for comparison with the corresponding strains in the intact case. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to test for difference at the 5% significance level. Surface analog bone strain after CoCr implantation indicated strain shielding (R2= 0.6178 with slope, \u03b2 = 0.4314) and was lower than the intact case (p = 0.014). The strain after implantation with the PEEK implant deviated less from the intact case (R2= 0.7972 with slope \u03b2 = 0.939) with no difference (p = 0.231).\nQuestion: Does a PEEK Femoral TKA Implant Preserve Intact Femoral Surface Strains Compared With CoCr?", "gt": "The strain shielding observed with the contemporary CoCr implant, consistent with clinical bone mineral density change data reported by others, may be reduced by using a PEEK implant.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Yes, a PEEK femoral TKA implant preserves intact femoral surface strains more closely compared with a CoCr implant. This conclusion is supported by the experimental results where the PEEK implant showed less deviation from the intact bone strain (R\u00b2 = 0.7972, slope \u03b2 = 0.939) and no statistically significant difference (p = 0.231) when compared to the intact bone. In contrast, the CoCr implant indicated strain shielding (R\u00b2 = 0.6178, slope \u03b2 = 0.4314) and showed a statistically significant lower strain compared to the intact bone (p = 0.014). This suggests that the PEEK implant induces a more physiologically normal bone strain distribution, closer to that of the intact bone, than the CoCr implant."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Anemia in chronic heart failure (CHF) is common, varying in prevalence between 14.4% and 55%, and is more frequent in patients with more severe heart failure. Patients with CHF who have anemia have a poorer quality of life, higher hospital admission rates, and reduced exercise tolerance. We explored the relation between hematinic levels and hemoglobin (Hb) levels and exercise tolerance in a group of patients with CHF. We analyzed data from 173 patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD), 123 patients with symptoms of heart failure, but preserved left ventricular (LV) systolic function (\"diastolic dysfunction\"), and 58 control subjects of similar age. Each underwent echocardiography, a 6-minute walk test, and blood tests for renal function and Hb and hematinic levels (vitamin B12, iron, and folate). We classified patients as having no anemia (Hb level>12.5 g/dL), mild anemia (Hb level from 11.5-12.5 g/dL), or moderate anemia (Hb level<11.5 g/dL). Of patients with LVSD, 16% had moderate anemia and 19% had mild anemia. Of patients with preserved LV function, 16% had moderate anemia and 17% had mild anemia. Four control subjects had a Hb level<12.5 g/dL. Of all patients, 6% were vitamin B12 deficient, 13% were iron deficient, and 8% were folate deficient. There was no difference between patients with LVSD and the diastolic dysfunction group. In patients with LVSDS, the average Hb level was lower in New York Heart Association class III than classes II and I. The distance walked in 6 minutes correlated with Hb level in both groups of patients with CHF (r = 0.29; P<.0001). Patients with anemia achieved a lower pVO2 (15.0 [2.3] vs 19.5 [4.4], P<.05). Peak oxygen consumption correlated with Hb level (r = 0.21, P<.05) in the patients, but not in the control subjects. In patients with anemia, the mean creatinine level was higher than in patients with a Hb level>12.5 g/dL, but there was no clear relationship with simple regression. Hematocrit level and mean corpuscular volume were not different in the patients with diastolic dysfunction, patients with LV dysfunction, or the control subjects. Hematocrit levels were not influenced by diuretic dose. Patients with anemia were not more likely to be hematinic deficient than patients without anemia.\nQuestion: Are hematinic deficiencies the cause of anemia in chronic heart failure?", "gt": "Patients with symptoms and signs of CHF have a high prevalence of anemia (34%) whether they have LV dysfunction or diastolic dysfunction, but few patients have hematinic deficiency. Hemoglobin levels correlate with subjective and objective measures of severity and renal function.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the context provided, hematinic deficiencies (deficiencies in vitamin B12, iron, and folate) do not appear to be the primary cause of anemia in chronic heart failure (CHF). The data shows that only a small percentage of patients were deficient in these hematinics: 6% were vitamin B12 deficient, 13% were iron deficient, and 8% were folate deficient. Moreover, the text explicitly states that \"Patients with anemia were not more likely to be hematinic deficient than patients without anemia.\" This suggests that while hematinic deficiencies can occur in patients with CHF, they are not the main cause of anemia in this population. The anemia in CHF patients seems to be more related to the severity of heart failure and has implications for exercise tolerance and quality of life."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Endoscopic vein harvesting is one of the most popular minimally invasive vein-harvesting techniques for coronary artery bypass graft surgery. It is associated with improved cosmetic outcome and fewer wound-related problems compared with the conventional open technique. However, its efficacy with regard to conduit damage and long-term patency has recently been questioned. Learning curve-associated trauma to the vein has a major impact on vein quality and the incidence of graft failure post-surgery. In an attempt to address this problem, we have devised and tested a learning tool termed Manchester Endoscopic Learning Tool (MELT). In this study, we compare vein quality following MELT training with standard recommended training. Fourteen practitioners across seven UK centres were enrolled into the study. Practitioners were categorized into two groups receiving MELT or standard training. Data were collected prospectively from the first eight vein retrievals per operator following training. A total of n = 112 vein-harvesting procedures were included in the study. Veins harvested by MELT practitioners had fewer small avulsions (P<0.001), required fewer repairs (P<0.001) and experienced a lower incidence of bruising (P<0.001) than veins obtained by practitioners receiving standard training. The incidence of very short side branches requiring repair was also significantly reduced (P<0.001) in the MELT group compared with standard training.\nQuestion: Does the introduction of a comprehensive structured training programme for endoscopic vein harvesting improve conduit quality?", "gt": "Our formalized training programme consistently minimizes vein trauma resulting in better-quality conduits when compared with the current standard training. Exposure of surgical practitioners to the structured curriculum during their endoscopic vein harvesting training will enhance their learning and lead to better-quality conduits. This is likely to impart clinical benefit post-surgery.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Yes, the introduction of a comprehensive structured training programme, specifically the Manchester Endoscopic Learning Tool (MELT), for endoscopic vein harvesting does improve conduit quality.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: We report our experience with ureterocalyceal anastomosis in children regarding indications and outcome. A retrospective review was performed of all cases that underwent open ureterocalyceal anastomosis at our center between 2000 and 2006. Records were reviewed for patient age, history, affected side, indication of surgery and operative details. Clinical and radiological outcome was assessed. Success was defined as both symptomatic relief and radiographic resolution of obstruction at last follow up. There were 10 cases (six males, four females) with a mean age of 6.5 years (range 3-13 years). Follow up ranged from 6 to 46 months (mean 18). The indications for surgery were failed pyeloplasty in six patients and iatrogenic injury of the ureteropelvic junction or the upper ureter in four. No significant perioperative complications were encountered in the study group. Overall success rate was 80%. Relief of obstruction was evident in eight patients as documented by intravenous urography or nuclear renography, while secondary nephrectomy was necessitated in two patients with severely impaired ipsilateral renal function and normal contralateral kidney. In patients with preserved renal units, the differential function on the involved side was stable on comparing the preoperative and postoperative renographic clearance (26 vs 24 ml/min).\nQuestion: Ureterocalyceal anastomosis in children: is it still indicated?", "gt": "Ureterocalyceal anastomosis in children is still indicated in some difficult situations. Excellent functional results can be achieved in properly selected cases. Nephrectomy may be indicated in cases with impaired renal function and inability to perform salvage procedure.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the context provided, ureterocalyceal anastomosis in children remains a viable surgical option, particularly in cases where there has been a failure of pyeloplasty or when there is an iatrogenic injury to the ureteropelvic junction or upper ureter.

This suggests that, in carefully selected cases, ureterocalyceal anastomosis can be an effective procedure for managing obstruction and preserving renal function in children. However, the decision to perform this surgery should be made on a case-by-case basis, considering factors such as the nature of the obstruction, the patient's age, and the overall renal function."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Myocarditis is an inflammation of the heart muscle and represents a challenge for diagnosis and treatment. On account of the lack of sensitivity and specificity of routine cardiac tests, there is a need for accurate diagnostic imaging. The aim of this study is to review the role of gated 99Tc-methoxyisobutylisonitrile myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (G-MPS) in the diagnosis and follow-up of the patients with myocarditis in comparison with gallium scintigraphy. Thirteen patients with a clinical diagnosis of myocarditis were included in the study. All underwent rest G-MPS and the images were then evaluated by quantitative perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography and quantitative gated single photon emission computed tomography software program. Visual evaluation of perfusion was performed as well as analysis of motion with thickening function [expressed as summed rest score, summed motion score, and summed thickening score (STS)] with calculation of ejection fraction (EF) and lung-to-heart (L/H) ratio. Eight patients underwent 67Ga scintigraphy. Clinical, echocardiography, and cardiac enzymes (creatinine kinase-MB, myoglobulin, troponin T, brain natriuretic peptide) data were gathered from the patients' charts. Clinical outcome was grouped according to prognosis. Spearman's correlation (SC) test was used for comparison analysis. Myocardial perfusion defects were observed in eight patients. Perfusion defects in the left ventricle involve a mean of 7.25% (range: 1-11%), whereas wall motion abnormality on G-MPS was more prominent, which showed to be a better marker for myocardial inflammation and necrosis. The 67Ga scintigraphy findings were normal in all, but two. The G-MPS EF (33+/-21%) was slightly lower than the echocardiography EF (40+/-15%), but with close correlation (SC coefficient: 0.635). Comparison of scintigraphic findings with clinical parameters showed that summed motion score with G-MPS EF and STS with L/H ratios were highly correlated (0.932 and 0.622, respectively). The maximum brain natriuretic peptide and L/H ratio with STS were highly correlated with the patients' outcomes (SC coefficient: -0.621, 0.821, and 0.579, respectively), as well.\nQuestion: Gated myocardial perfusion scintigraphy in children with myocarditis: can it be considered as an indicator of clinical outcome?", "gt": "Tc-methoxyisobutylisonitrile G-MPS is therefore helpful in providing additional diagnostic and prognostic information in patients with myocarditis.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the context provided, gated myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (G-MPS) appears to have potential as an indicator of clinical outcomes in patients with myocarditis.

Additionally, the maximum brain natriuretic peptide levels, often indicative of heart failure severity, were also correlated with the L/H ratio and STS. These findings suggest that G-MPS can provide valuable information about the extent of myocardial involvement and potentially predict the prognosis of patients with myocarditis. However, it is important to note that the study sample size was small (13 patients), and further research with larger cohorts would be necessary to confirm these preliminary findings and establish G-MPS as a reliable indicator of clinical outcomes in myocarditis."}

Clear surgical margins can be achieved while simultaneously improving symptomatic macromastia and enhancing aesthetic outcomes. Little has been written about postoperative complications after this procedure, beyond the risk of locoregional recurrence. This study aimed to compare the complication profile for oncoplastic breast reduction versus reduction for benign macromastia. A retrospective review of our experience with oncoplastic breast reduction was performed. This represented a consecutive series of 118 patients undergoing bilateral breast reduction during the 7-year study period from March 2005 to March 2012. There were 64 patients identified who underwent oncoplastic breast reduction. Patients were determined to be a good candidate for breast conservation therapy if it was felt that clear surgical margins could be obtained without mastectomy. Postoperative complications (within 6 weeks of surgery) were compared to a control group of 56 patients undergoing reduction for benign macromastia. The associations between complications and potential risk factors were analyzed using logistic regression. Patients undergoing oncoplastic breast reduction and reduction for benign macromastia had some key differences. In general, macromastia patients were younger (mean age, 42.3 vs 57.5 years; P<0.001) and had lower body mass index (mean, 26.1 vs 30.6 kg/m2; P<0.001) compared to those patients having oncoplastic reduction. Within the oncoplastic reduction group, 14 (21.9%) patients had a total of 16 complications; among the benign macromastia group, 9 (16.1%) patients had a total of 10 complications (P = 0.420). On univariate analysis, oncoplastic reduction was not predictive of having a perioperative complication (odds ratio, 1.462; 95% confidence interval, 0.579-3.696; P = 0.422).

The only exception was piroxicam, where the peak plasma concentration was lower in bleeders compared to controls, but this finding alone does not support the hypothesis that altered pharmacokinetics are a risk factor for bleeding.\n\nThe study's primary finding that pharmacokinetic factors were largely similar between the groups suggests that other factors, such as duration of therapy or other clinical factors, might play a more significant role in the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding associated with NSAID use."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Although the use of laparoscopy for the management of postoperative complications has been previously well documented for different pathologies, there is scarce information regarding its use after laparoscopic colorectal surgery. Data were prospectively collected from all patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal surgery between June 2000 to October 2007. Patients were divided into two groups according to the approach used for the reoperation: laparoscopy (Group I) or laparotomy (Group II). Data were statistically analyzed by using Student's t-test and chi-squared test. In all, 510 patients were analyzed. Twenty-seven patients (5.2 percent), 14 men and 13 women (men/women Group I: 10/7 vs. Group II: 4/6; P = not significant (NS)), required a second surgery because of postoperative complications (Group I: 17 (63 percent); Group II: 10 (37 percent)). Mean age was 60 +/- 17 years (Group I: 61.7 +/- 17.7 vs. Group II: 57.1 +/- 16 years; P = NS). Fifteen patients (55.5 percent) had anastomotic leaks (Group I 13/17 (76.5 percent) vs. Group II 2/13 (15 percent); P = 0.004). The were no differences between the groups regarding the length of stay or postoperative complications (Group I: 11.9 +/- 9.6 vs. Group II: 18.1 +/- 19.7 days: P = NS; Group I: 1 vs. Group II: 3; P = NS).\nQuestion: Is a laparoscopic approach useful for treating complications after primary laparoscopic colorectal surgery?", "gt": "Laparoscopic approach is a useful tool for treating complications after laparoscopic colorectal surgery, especially anastomotic leaks. Randomized, controlled trials are necessary to validate these findings.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the provided context, a laparoscopic approach appears to be useful for treating complications after primary laparoscopic colorectal surgery. The data show that among the patients needing a second surgery due to postoperative complications, a majority (63%) were managed with a laparoscopic approach (Group I). A significant finding is that a higher proportion of anastomotic leaks, a common complication after colorectal surgery, were managed laparoscopically (76.5% in Group I vs. 15% in Group II), and this difference was statistically significant (P = 0.004). Additionally, there were no significant differences between the groups regarding the length of hospital stay or the occurrence of postoperative complications, suggesting that the laparoscopic approach does not negatively impact these outcomes. Therefore, the laparoscopic approach seems to be a viable and potentially advantageous method for managing postoperative complications after primary laparoscopic colorectal surgery."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Implantable left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) were designed for permanent implant, but we began their use for bridge-to-transplant (BTTx) to study their safety and effectiveness. We review our experience in order to compare the BTTx lessons learned with the outcomes and goals of permanent implants. From December 1991 until January 2002, 264 patients received 277 LVADs for BTTx. We analyzed temporal trends in pre-LVAD patient factors and device-specific time-related complications. Survival to transplant was 69%. Adverse event analysis demonstrated a high risk of infections (0.56, 1.28, and 1.88 per patient at 30 days and 3 and 6 months). HeartMate devices were more prone to infection than Novacor devices (p<0.0001). Cerebral infarctions occurred less commonly than infections (0.15, 0.25, 0.30 at 30 days and 3 and 6 months), were more common in Novacor than HeartMate (p = 0.0001), and were decreased by the new Novacor Vascutek conduit (p = 0.07), but these were still slightly higher than the HeartMate (p = 0.04). Device failures occurred in 21 instances (all but one were in HeartMate devices [p = 0.04 vs Novacor]), but have significantly decreased (p<0.0001) in HeartMate since 1998.\nQuestion: Do left ventricular assist device (LVAD) bridge-to-transplantation outcomes predict the results of permanent LVAD implantation?", "gt": "Infections and device durability limit the chronic use of the HeartMate device, but device failures are decreasing. Novacor has fewer problems with infection and durability, and the new Vascutek conduit will reduce, but not eliminate, strokes.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "The outcomes of LVADs used in a bridge-to-transplant (BTTx) setting can provide valuable insights into the potential results of permanent LVAD implantation, but there are several factors to consider when making this comparison:\n\n1. **Survival to Transplant**: The survival rate to transplant of 69% in the BTTx setting indicates that LVADs can effectively support patients awaiting a heart transplant. This suggests that LVADs can provide sufficient circulatory support to keep patients alive in the long term, which is a crucial aspect of permanent implantation outcomes.\n\n2. **Complications**: The high incidence of infections (0.56, 1.28, and 1.88 per patient at 30 days and 3 and 6 months) and cerebral infarctions (0.15, 0.25, 0.30 at 30 days and 3 and 6 months) observed in the BTTx setting indicates that these are significant risks that could also be expected in permanent LVAD implantation. The differences in complication rates between the HeartMate and Novacor devices suggest that device-specific designs and improvements (like the new Novacor Vascutek conduit) can influence outcomes.\n\n3. **Device Failures**: The occurrence of 21 device failures, primarily in HeartMate devices, highlights the importance of device reliability. The significant reduction in device failures in HeartMate devices since 1998 suggests that technological advancements can improve the durability and reliability of LVADs, which is critical for permanent implantation.\n\nIn summary, while the BTTx outcomes provide a baseline for understanding the safety and effectiveness of LVADs, the transition to permanent implantation would likely involve ongoing monitoring of complications and the continuous improvement of device designs to enhance patient outcomes. The lessons learned from the BTTx experience can help refine patient selection criteria, surgical techniques, and post-implantation care for permanent LVAD implantation."}

Patient characteristics and clinical/therapeutic history were collected on the day of blood draw for viral load (VL). Analysis was stratified for non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (EFV or NVP). A logistic regression model weighted for patients' baseline characteristics was used to assess the likelihood of virologic success (<80 copies/ml) in patients with TDF- as compared to AZT-backbones. In total 1539 patients were included in the analysis. Most were clinically and immunologically stable (clinical failure: 2.7% (AZT) and 2.8% (TDF); immunological failure: 4.6% (AZT) and 4.8% (TDF)). In EFV-based regimens (n = 1162), TDF was significantly associated with higher rates of virologic suppression than AZT (93.8% vs. 88.1%; weighted odds ratio: 2.15 (95% CI: 1.29-3.58; P = 0.003)). In NVP-based regimens, a similar trend was observed, but not significant (89.4% vs. 86.7%; 1.99 (0.83-4.75, P = 0.121)).\nQuestion: Is zidovudine first-line therapy virologically comparable to tenofovir in resource-limited settings?", "gt": "These findings support the WHO recommendation to use TDF/3TC/EFV as first-line regimen.

To determine whether the frequency of negative challenge tests in children with a history of anaphylaxis to foods is frequent enough to warrant challenge testing to re-evaluate the diagnosis of anaphylaxis, and to document the safety of this procedure. All children (n=441) who underwent a double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) between January 2003 and March 2007 were screened for symptoms of anaphylaxis to food by history. Anaphylaxis was defined as symptoms and signs of cardiovascular instability, occurring within 2 h after ingestion of the suspected food. Twenty-one children were enrolled (median age 6.1 years, range 0.8-14.4). The median time interval between the most recent anaphylactic reaction and the DBPCFC was 4.25 years, range 0.3-12.8. Twenty-one DBPCFCs were performed in 21 children. Eighteen of 21 children were sensitized to the food in question. Six DBPCFCs were negative (29%): three for cows milk, one for egg, one for peanut, and one for wheat.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: To investigate the relationship between physical impairment and brain-computer interface (BCI) performance. We present a meta-analysis of 29 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and six patients with other severe neurological diseases in different stages of physical impairment who were trained with a BCI. In most cases voluntary regulation of slow cortical potentials has been used as input signal for BCI-control. More recently sensorimotor rhythms and the P300 event-related brain potential were recorded. A strong correlation has been found between physical impairment and BCI performance, indicating that performance worsens as impairment increases. Seven patients were in the complete locked-in state (CLIS) with no communication possible. After removal of these patients from the analysis, the relationship between physical impairment and BCI performance disappeared. The lack of a relation between physical impairment and BCI performance was confirmed when adding BCI data of patients from other BCI research groups.\nQuestion: Brain-computer interfaces and communication in paralysis: extinction of goal directed thinking in completely paralysed patients?", "gt": "Basic communication (yes/no) was not restored in any of the CLIS patients with a BCI.

However, when patients in the complete locked-in state (CLIS), characterized by no possible communication, were excluded from the analysis, the correlation between physical impairment and BCI performance vanished. This suggests that for patients who are not in the CLIS, there is a direct relationship between the severity of their physical impairment and their ability to use BCIs effectively. For those in the CLIS, the data suggest that the ability to use BCIs may be significantly compromised, or possibly absent, which could imply an extinction or severe limitation of goal-directed thinking in these patients.

This was a cohort study with up to 4 years of follow-up. Patients who underwent 1 of 5 common inpatient abdominal operations were identified in 2005-2008 American College of Surgeons NSQIP data linked to Medicare inpatient records. The main outcomes included occurrence of an incisional hernia repair. A multivariable, shared frailty Cox proportional hazards regression was used to compare each hospital's incisional hernia rate with the overall mean rate for all hospitals and control for American College of Surgeons NSQIP preoperative clinical variables. A total of 37,134 patients underwent 1 of 5 common inpatient abdominal operations, including colectomy, small bowel resection, ventral hernia repair, pancreatic resection, or cholecystectomy, at 1 of 216 hospitals participating in American College of Surgeons NSQIP during the 4-year period. There were 1,474 (4.0%) patients who underwent an incisional hernia repair, at a median follow-up time of 16 months (interquartile range 8 to 25 months) after initial abdominal surgery.

One hundred fifty-nine pregnant women (80 seen in a public clinic, 79 seen in a private practice) completed two questionnaires about 38 topics commonly cited as important during pregnancy. At the first prenatal visit, the women reported their level of interest in each of the topics. At 36 to 40 weeks' gestation the women completed a second questionnaire to assess whether information was provided for each topic and whether they had learned as much as desired. Overall, the women in the public sector received more information than did the women who were cared for privately. This was statistically significant at the p<0.05 level for 25 of the 38 topics. Satisfaction with information learned was highly correlated with information received during prenatal care, but, surprisingly, it was not shown to be associated with the patient's interest level at the first visit.

Length of stay, hospital costs, and morbidity, mortality, and readmission rates for the four most common vascular diagnosis-related group (DRG) categories at our institution were compared with Medicare standards. The four categories were DRG 005 (extracranial vascular procedures), DRG 110 (aortic and renal procedures), DRG 478 (leg bypass with comorbidity), and DRG 479 (leg bypass without comorbidity). Between May 1, 1994, and June 30, 1996, 112 patients underwent carotid endarterectomy, 42 patients underwent aortic or renal procedures, and 130 patients underwent lower extremity bypass procedures (68% with comorbidity). Only Medicare patients were included because exact cost/reimbursement data were available. No admissions were excluded. The average length of stay was 1.2 days for DRG 005, 6.9 days for DRG 110, and 3.2 and 2.1 days for DRGs 478 and 479, respectively. The average cost savings when compared with the Medicare reimbursement was $4338 for DRG 005, $7161 for DRG 110, $4108 for DRG 478, and $2313 for DRG 479. Readmission was necessary for 9% of peripheral bypass patients. Ten percent of patients in DRG 005 and 86% of patients in DRG 110 needed intensive care, whereas only 2% of patients who underwent complicated bypass procedures did. Ninety percent of carotid endarterectomy patients and 23% of leg bypass patients were discharged on the first postoperative day. There were two postoperative strokes (2%) after carotid surgery. Thirty-three percent of aortic/renal patients had complications that led to care outside the clinical pathway. Twenty-five percent of leg bypass patients required home care to treat open foot wounds.

In prostate cancer (PCa), the expression and functional role of CCL11 have not been intensively investigated so far. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the diagnostic or prognostic potential of Eotaxin-1 in PCa patients. We analyzed serum from 140 patients who have undergone prostate biopsy due to elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels as well as serum of 20 individuals with PSA levels<\u20091ng/ml (healthy control group). Moreover, 40 urine samples were analyzed. A custom-made Q-Plex array ELISA (Quansys Biosciences) for the detection of Eotaxin-1 was performed and Q-View Software used for quantification. In addition, clinical courses of patients documented in our Prostate Biobank database were analyzed. ROC and survival analyses were used to determine the diagnostic and prognostic power of Eotaxin-1 levels. Serum Eotaxin-1 levels were significantly decreased in PCa (P\u2009=\u20090.006) as well as in benign prostate hyperplasia (P\u2009=\u20090.0006) compared to the control group. ROC analysis revealed that Eotaxin-1 is a significant marker to distinguish PCa from disease-free prostate.

This decrease was also observed in urine samples from PCa patients, indicating that Eotaxin-1 could potentially serve as a biomarker for distinguishing PCa from disease-free prostate. However, the levels of Eotaxin-1 did not correlate with the aggressiveness of PCa, as measured by the Gleason score, nor did they predict biochemical recurrence or impact progression-free survival.

The mean age of the study population was 59.66 +/- 1.52 years. The foot ulcer led to the diagnosis of diabetes in six patients in whom the condition was previously unidentified. Of the 54 patients with foot ulcers, nine (16.7%) were selected for surgery and the remaining 45 were managed conservatively. Microbiological investigations were available for 21 patients. Proteus mirabilis was the most frequent microorganism yielded, and was regularly associated with Staphylococcus aureus. All the microorganisms isolated showed high sensitivity to second-generation quinolone antibiotics and were regularly sensitive to aminoglycoside antibiotics. Nine (16.7%) patients died and seven (13%) were discharged at their own request.\nQuestion: Diabetic foot ulcers in Cameroon: can microflora prevalence inform probabilistic antibiotic treatment?", "gt": "The mortality rate among our diabetic patients with foot ulcers is high and the combination of second-generation quinolone and aminoglycoside antibiotics can be proposed as a probabilistic antibiotic approach to treating foot infection.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the provided context, the prevalence of microflora in diabetic foot ulcers in Cameroon can indeed inform probabilistic antibiotic treatment. The study from the Yaound\u00e9 Central Hospital indicates that specific microorganisms are frequently associated with diabetic foot ulcers in this population. Proteus mirabilis was found to be the most frequent microorganism, often co-occurring with Staphylococcus aureus. Given that all the isolated microorganisms showed high sensitivity to second-generation quinolone antibiotics and were regularly sensitive to aminoglycoside antibiotics, healthcare providers could use this information to guide empirical antibiotic treatment before the results of microbiological investigations are available.\n\nEmpirical treatment, based on the probable microflora and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns, can be crucial in the early management of diabetic foot ulcers, where prompt and effective antimicrobial therapy can prevent complications such as infection escalation, amputation, and even death. However, this approach should be complemented with culture and sensitivity testing where possible to ensure that the chosen antibiotic therapy is appropriate for the specific pathogens involved in each case."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Although it has been known that folate will participate in colorectal carcinogenesis, the relationship between blood folate level and colorectal cancer is less consistent. The blood folate level does not reflect the systemic folate status. By contrast, serum homocysteine has become a sensitive marker for the folate deficiency. We attempted to explain the correlation between folate and colorectal cancer according to the serum homocysteine level. We reviewed the clinical records, including alcohol history of 184 patients taking the colonoscopy and measurement of the serum homocysteine level at Health Promotion Center from 2001 to 2002. One hundred fifty-one of 184 were included, excluding 33 patients with previous history of colonic polyp, cerebrovascular, cardiovascular attack and thromboembolism. They were divided into the normal control (n=111) and the adenomatous polyp group (n=40). We had selected the colorectal cancer group (n=50) from the collection list of the tissue and blood bank less than 3 months storage interval. There was no significant difference in the mean serum homocysteine level among three groups. However, in the subjects with high alcohol consumption, there was a significant difference in the mean serum homocysteine between the normal control (n=7) and the adenomatous polyp group (n=9) (10.2 vs 15.1 mumol/L, p<0.05).\nQuestion: Is serum homocysteine level elevated in colorectal tumor?", "gt": "There was no correlation of serum homocysteine and colorectal tumor. However, in the subjects with high alcohol consumption, high serum homocysteine might be related to the development of adenomatous polyp.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the context provided, there is no significant difference in the mean serum homocysteine level among the normal control group, the adenomatous polyp group, and the colorectal cancer group when considering all subjects. However, the study does note a significant difference in the mean serum homocysteine levels between the normal control and the adenomatous polyp group specifically in subjects with high alcohol consumption. In these high alcohol consumers, the mean serum homocysteine level was higher in the adenomatous polyp group (15.1 \u03bcmol/L) compared to the normal control group (10.2 \u03bcmol/L), with a p-value less than 0.05 indicating statistical significance.\n\nTherefore, while serum homocysteine levels do not appear to be generally elevated in colorectal tumors across all patients, the context suggests that in individuals with high alcohol consumption, there is an association between elevated serum homocysteine levels and the presence of adenomatous polyps, which are precursors to colorectal cancer. This implies that in certain subgroups, such as those with high alcohol consumption, elevated serum homocysteine might be a marker for an increased risk of colorectal tumors."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Women with fertility problems experience a higher prevalence of negative emotions than women without fertility problems. The goal of this study was to compare the effects of psychological intervention with psychotropic medication on the mental health improvement of depressed infertile women. In a randomized controlled clinical trial, 89 depressed infertile women that they were recruited and divided into three groups in three groups: cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), antidepressant therapy, and a control group. Twenty-nine participants in the CBT method received 10 sessions on relaxation training, restructuring, and eliminating negative automatic thoughts and dysfunctional attitudes to infertility. Thirty participants in the pharmacotherapic group took 20mg fluoxetine daily for 90 days. Thirty control subjects did not receive any intervention. All participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) at the beginning and end of the study. Paired t-test, ANOVA, chi(2), and McNemar tests were used to analyze the data. Fluoxetine significantly reduced the mean of three subscale scores of the GHQ anxiety (7.3+/-4.1 vs. 5.1+/-3.2), social function (7+/-2.8 vs. 4.3+/-2), and depression (7.8+/-5.2 vs. 4.4+/-2.2) but could not significantly change the mean score of psychosomatic signs. The CBT method effectively reduced the mean of all four GHQ subscales: anxiety (8+/-4 vs. 3.2+/-2), social function (7.2+/-2.6 vs. 4.7+/-2.5), depression (7.7+/-4.2 vs. 3.6+/-2.7), and psychosomatic signs (7.5+/-3.2 vs. 5.5+/-3.2). Also, both methods significantly reduced the total GHQ scores. Successful treatment of depression in three groups was fluoxetine group 50%, CBT 79.3%, and control 10%. The mean Beck scores among the groups at the beginning and end of study were, respectively: fluoxetine 23.2+/-8.6 versus 14.3+/-8.5 (p<0.001), CBT 20+/-7.9 versus 7.7+/-4.8 (p<0.001), and control 19.8+/-8.5 versus 19.7+/-8.4 (p=0.9). Although both fluoxetine and CBT significantly decreased the mean BDI scores more than the control group, the decrease in the CBT group was significantly greater than the fluoxetine group.\nQuestion: Is psychotherapy a reliable alternative to pharmacotherapy to promote the mental health of infertile women?", "gt": "Psychotherapy, such as group CBT, was superior to or at least as effective as pharmacotherapy to promote the well being of depressed infertile women.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the study described, psychotherapy, specifically cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), appears to be a reliable alternative to pharmacotherapy for promoting the mental health of infertile women.

The results indicated that both fluoxetine and CBT significantly reduced the mean scores on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the subscales of the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), including anxiety, social function, depression, and psychosomatic signs. However, CBT showed greater effectiveness in reducing the mean BDI scores compared to fluoxetine. Additionally, the successful treatment rate for depression was notably higher in the CBT group (79.3%) compared to the fluoxetine group (50%). These findings suggest that CBT can be as effective, if not more so, than pharmacotherapy in improving the mental health of infertile women experiencing depression."}

The subjects of the study are 2601 children who were diagnosed with headache. Data on the children and the parents was collected using a detailed data form. The diagnosis of headache in children was made on the basis of the criteria of the International Headache Society (IHS). If the parents of a child diagnosed with headache reported that their child had headache, the parent was evaluated to be aware of his/her child's headache. In the statistical analyses, chi-square and binary logistic regression were used. Almost 74% of parents were aware of their children's headache. It was found that migraine type headache, female gender, being the first child of the family, travel sickness of children, the presence of headache history in one of the family members; the number of family members and mother's age are factors that affect the awareness level of parents.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Aminoglycosides have been reported to produce a curare-like neuromuscular blockade in animals at serum concentrations higher than those obtained with traditional dosing (1-2 mg/kg every 8 h) in humans. Aminoglycoside-induced neuromuscular blockade is rarely, if ever, seen in humans with traditional dosing. The recent adoption of once-daily dosing of aminoglycosides has raised concerns about increased potential for this adverse effect because higher serum concentrations are produced. The objective of this study was to determine if once-daily dosing of aminoglycosides inhibits respiratory muscle function. Nine mechanically ventilated ICU patients on once-daily dosing of gentamicin 6 mg/kg/day were assessed for respiratory muscle strength by measuring maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP). MIP is a measurement of the maximal negative pressure generated by repeated inhalations against an occluded airway over 20 s. This was measured within 1 hour before (MIPpre) and within 1 hour after each aminoglycoside dose (MIPpost). Mean values for MIPpre and MIPpost were -26.7 cm H2O and -26.5 cm H2O, respectively. The mean difference between MIPpre and MIPpost was -0.2 cm H2O, which was not statistically significant (P>0.05).\nQuestion: Does once-daily dosing of aminoglycosides affect neuromuscular function?", "gt": "The effect of gentamicin (6 mg/kg/day) on respiratory muscle function was not statistically, nor clinically significant, and weaning from mechanical ventilation does not seem to be inhibited by once-daily dosing of aminoglycosides as detectable by measurement of MIP.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the study described, once-daily dosing of aminoglycosides, specifically gentamicin at a dose of 6 mg/kg/day, does not appear to affect neuromuscular function in terms of respiratory muscle strength.

Twenty-seven adult patients with autoimmune Addison's disease on stable glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement therapy (RT) attending the Department of Endocrinology of a university teaching hospital were included in this study. Adrenocortical function was assessed by performing an adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) (250 \u03bcg Synacthen) stimulation test (SST) after interruption of current glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid RT. A normal adrenal response was defined as a serum cortisol concentration \u2265500 nm 30 or 60 min after stimulation. Partial recovery was defined as a cortisol concentration \u2265100 and \u2264500 nm after stimulation. In 17 patients (63%), serum cortisol concentrations remained undetectable 30 and 60 min after the administration of ACTH. None of the remaining 10 participants had a normal response.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Measurement of Peak Nasal Inspiratory Flow (PNIF) seems to be a cheap and easily performed method to assess nasal patency. As demonstrated in a previous work, PNIF is influenced by SEX, AGE and HEIGHT. However there is a large degree of between-patient variability in PNIF levels. The purpose of this analysis is to determine whether the measurement of the pulmonary ventilatory capacity, by mean of Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF), enables more precise determination of PNIF. Repeated measurements of PNIF and PEF were performed in 112 volunteers. 100 of these fulfilled the study criteria (55 females and 45 males) and all of them were non-smokers, non-asthmatic, without nose and paranasal sinuses problems, with ages ranging from 15 to 71 years. Statistical analysis was undertaken to determine whether a relationship existed between PNIF and age, sex and height, but which also considered PEF. The data from both experiments were analysed together. In both groups there is a clear tendency for PNIF to increase with PEF. As clearly demonstrated in this work the value of PEF is informative in predicting PNIF and that the larger the value of PEF, the larger the value of PNIF.\nQuestion: Does peak nasal inspiratory flow relate to peak expiratory flow?", "gt": "PNIF is a useful method to study nasal patency in both primary and secondary care to aid diagnosis of nasal disease, but low values of PNIF have to be confirmed by a study of the PEF as PNIF low values may be an expression of low ventilatory activity rather than an expression of nasal obstruction.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Yes, peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF) does relate to peak expiratory flow (PEF).

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Increasing concentrations of N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) retinamide (4-HPR)-treatment pushed autophagy down to apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner, and 4-HPR-induced ROS contribute to this process. Since we found that ASK1-regulated JNK1 and p38 are responsible for 4-HPR-induced autophagy and apoptosis, respectively, we further utilized co-immunoprecipitation followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis to identify proteins that specifically bind to ASK1 under different oxidative states. Of note, DJ-1, a crucial antioxidant protein, was identified. Interestingly, DJ-1 functions as a redox sensor that senses ROS levels and determines the cellular response to 4-HPR: Under mild oxidative stress, moderate oxidation of DJ-1 is recruited to inhibit the activity of ASK1 and maintain cell viability by activating autophagy; under a lethal level of oxidative stress, excessive oxidized DJ-1 dissociates from ASK1 and activates it, thereby initiating p38 activation and enabling the cells to commit to apoptosis. Moreover, the depletion of DJ-1 increases the sensitivity of tumor cells to 4-HPR both in vitro and in vivo. Our results reveal that the different oxidation states of DJ-1 function as a cellular redox sensor of ROS caused by 4-HPR and determine the cell fate of autophagy or apoptosis. Moreover, the results suggest that DJ-1 might be a potent therapeutic target for cancer treatment.\nQuestion: The oxidation states of DJ-1 dictate the cell fate in response to oxidative stress triggered by 4-hpr: autophagy or apoptosis?", "gt": "ROS-mediated changes in the oxidation state of DJ-1 are involved in 4-HPR's effect on pushing autophagy down to apoptosis.

Conversely, under severe oxidative stress, DJ-1 becomes excessively oxidized, leading to its dissociation from ASK1 and the subsequent activation of p38, which promotes apoptosis. This dual role of DJ-1 as a redox sensor helps determine the cellular response to 4-HPR-induced oxidative stress."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Patients with incurable cancer are faced with difficult decisions regarding whether to take chemotherapy in an attempt to preserve the quality and/or prolong the quantity of their lives. The average prolongation in survival with chemotherapy compared with best supportive care has not been well described. We performed a literature search using PUBMED combined with expert inquiry to identify trials comparing cytotoxic chemotherapy with best supportive care. Twenty-five randomized, controlled clinical trials comparing cytotoxic chemotherapy with best supportive care were identified. Sixteen trials (64%) were in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Data were extracted and analyzed. Sufficient data for statistical modeling were available for NSCLC trials. The mean sample size of the NSCLC trials was 175 patients. Response rates in the treatment arms for NSCLC ranged from 7% to 42%. A relationship between response rate and survival was observed for NSCLC. The estimated relationship for NSCLC suggested that each 3.3% increase in response rate correlated, on average, with a 1-week increase in median survival, and each 2% increase in response rate correlated, on average, with a 1% increase in 1-year survival. The mean increase in 1-year survival for trials of agents with at least a 20% response rate in NSCLC was 16%.

In multivariate logistic regression analysis, AKI development was independently associated with NLR, alongside other factors such as the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score and the duration of invasive mechanical ventilation (MV). This statistical method controls for the effects of other variables, highlighting the independent predictive value of NLR.\n\n3. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve for NLR in predicting AKI was 0.986, which is notably higher than that for white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) (p<0.05). This high AUC suggests that NLR is a highly accurate predictor of AKI.\n\n4. The optimal cut-off value of NLR for predicting AKI in patients with severe sepsis was found to be 10.15, with a high sensitivity (90.2%), specificity (92.9%), negative-predictive value (90.4%), and positive-predictive value (92.7%) at this threshold.\n\nIn summary, the data strongly suggest that NLR can be used as an independent risk factor for predicting AKI in patients with severe sepsis, offering a valuable tool for early identification and intervention in this high-risk population."}

We conducted a retrospective study in our center to evaluate the effect of declining residual renal function on patients' nutritional status. All incident uremic patients (n = 46) who began peritoneal dialysis from January 1, 2003 June 1, 2003 in our center were closely followed for 1 year with focus on maintaining strict volume control with time on dialysis. Patient's residual renal function (RRF) was assessed by the average renal urea and creatinine clearances. Those patients who had more than 50% decrease in GFR were selected for the present analysis. Serum albumin (ALB), dietary protein intake (DPI) and subjective global assessment (SGA) were closely followed. There were 16 patients (9 males and 7 females) included in the present analysis, among whom 31.3% were diabetics. Patients' GFR declined significantly (RRF were 4.32 +/- 2.69, 2.99 +/- 2.21 and 1.24 +/- 0.99 ml/min for Months 1, 6 and 12, respectively, p<0.05), along with a significant decline in urine volume (985.62 +/- 543.29, 698.13 +/- 463.59 and 425.63 +/- 320.52 ml/d for Months 1, 6 and 12, respectively, p<0.01). Although weekly peritoneal Kt/V did not increase significantly, peritoneal ultrafiltration increased significantly during this period (428.75 +/- 408.96, 534.38 +/- 296.39, 844.38 +/- 440.35 ml for Months 1, 6 and 12, respectively, p<0.05).

In fact, the study found that despite a significant decline in GFR and urine volume over the course of one year, there was an increase in serum albumin levels and dietary protein intake. Additionally, the prevalence of malnutrition, as assessed by subjective global assessment (SGA), decreased from 62.5% at the start of dialysis to 18.8% by the end of the study. These findings suggest that, in this cohort, the decline in RRF was not associated with the development of malnutrition, and may even be accompanied by improvements in nutritional status. However, it is important to note that this is a specific study with a particular set of conditions and patient population, and the results may not generalize to all peritoneal dialysis patients."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Depletion of central nervous system catecholamines, including dopamine, can decrease MAC (the minimum alveolar concentration of an inhaled anesthetic required to suppress movement in response to a noxious stimulus in 50% of test subjects); release of central nervous system catecholamines, including dopamine, can increase MAC; and increased free dopamine concentrations in the striatum can decrease MAC. Such findings suggest that dopamine receptors might mediate part of the capacity of inhaled anesthetics to provide immobility in the face of noxious stimulation. We measured the effect of blockade of D2 dopamine-mediated transmission with 0.3 mg/kg or 3.0 mg/kg droperidol on the MAC of cyclopropane, desflurane, halothane, isoflurane, or sevoflurane in rats, and the effect of 3.0 mg/kg droperidol on the dose or concentration of etomidate (an anesthetic known to act principally by enhancing the response of gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) receptors to gamma-aminobutyric acid) required to suppress movement in response to noxious stimulation.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: An in vivo sheep model was used to investigate the effect of spinal instrumentation on the healing process of posterolateral spinal fusion. To examine the role of spinal instrumentation during the healing process of posterolateral fusion. In long bone fractures, internal fixation improves the union rate but does not accelerate the healing process. Spinal instrumentation also improves the fusion rate in spinal arthrodesis. However, it remains unclear whether the use of spinal instrumentation expedites the healing process of spinal fusion. Sixteen sheep underwent posterolateral spinal arthrodeses at L2-L3 and L4-L5 using equal amounts of autologous bone. One of those segments was selected randomly to be augmented with transpedicular screw fixation (Texas Scottish Rite Hospital spinal system). The animals were killed at 8 weeks or 16 weeks after surgery. Fusion status was evaluated by biomechanical testing, manual palpation, plain radiography, computed tomography, and histology. Instrumented fusion segments demonstrated significantly higher stiffness than did uninstrumented fusions at 8 weeks after surgery. Radiographic assessment and manual palpation showed that the use of spinal instrumentation improved the fusion rate at 8 weeks (47% versus 38% in radiographs, 86% versus 57% in manual palpation). Histologically, the instrumented fusions consisted of more woven bone than the uninstrumented fusions at 8 weeks after surgery. The 16-week-old fusion mass was diagnosed biomechanically, radiographically, and histologically as solid, regardless of pedicle screw augmentation.\nQuestion: Does spinal instrumentation influence the healing process of posterolateral spinal fusion?", "gt": "The current study's results demonstrated that spinal instrumentation creates a stable mechanical environment to enhance the early bone healing of spinal fusion.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Yes, spinal instrumentation does influence the healing process of posterolateral spinal fusion.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: This study was conducted to determine whether vaccination with the quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine after loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) for high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2-3) is effective in preventing recurrence of CIN2-3. Between August 2007 and July 2010, 737 patients aged 20-45 years who were diagnosed with CIN2-3 were treated by LEEP and followed. Three hundred and sixty patients were vaccinated with the quadrivalent HPV vaccine after LEEP (vaccination group), and 377 patients were followed without vaccination (non-vaccination group). The vaccination group received the first dose at 1 week after LEEP and the remaining two doses two and six months later.

Prospective, randomized crossover study. Urban emergency department with approximate annual census of 60,000. Emergency medicine resident physicians at the Denver Health Residency in Emergency Medicine, a postgraduate year 1-4 training program. Resident physicians blinded to the study hypothesis used ultrasound guidance to cannulate the internal jugular and subclavian of a human torso mannequin using the long-axis and short-axis views at each site. An ultrasound fellow recorded skin breaks, redirections, and time to cannulation. An experienced ultrasound fellow or attending used a convex 8-4 MHz transducer during cannulation to monitor the needle path and determine posterior wall penetration. Generalized linear mixed models with a random subject effect were used to compare time to cannulation, number of skin breaks and redirections, and posterior wall penetration of the long axis and short axis at each cannulation site. Twenty-eight resident physicians participated: eight postgraduate year 1, eight postgraduate year 2, five postgraduate year 3, and seven postgraduate year 4. The median (interquartile range) number of total internal jugular central venous catheters placed was 27 (interquartile range, 9-42) and subclavian was six catheters (interquartile range, 2-20).

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: There are many risk classification schemes that determine both treatment and outcome for patients with papillary thyroid cancer. Most of these formulas often utilize tumor size as the key predictor of outcome. Furthermore, there is no clear consensus regarding the treatment of small papillary cancers. Therefore, we reviewed our experience in order to determine which factors best predict outcome for papillary thyroid cancer. In addition, we sought to establish a tumor size threshold beyond which papillary cancers require treatment. From May 1994 to October 2004, 174 patients underwent surgery for papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) at our institution. These patients were divided into five groups based on tumor size. The data from these groups were analyzed utilizing ANOVA, Chi-square and linear regression analysis. The mean age of the patients was 42 +/- 1 years and 126 (72%) were female. Mean tumor size was 17.2 +/- 1.1 mm. The overall outcome was quite good with a survival rate of 97% and a recurrence rate of 12%. On univariate analysis, there was no difference amongst the groups in regards to age or gender. However, there was a significantly higher incidence of lymph node metastasis amongst those with the largest tumors. Consequently, those patients with the largest tumors were treated more aggressively, with 75% undergoing total thyroidectomies and 85% receiving radioactive iodine therapy.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: The growing number of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infections worldwide and the increasing use of immunosuppressive modalities for organ transplantation have contributed to an epidemic of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), which has been etiologically linked to human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8) or KS-associated virus. Since the onset of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome epidemic, inflammation has been recognized as an essential component of KS pathology. HHV8 bears a gene (K1) encoding a transmembrane protein with an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif. This motif is present in receptors that mediate inflammation. To dissect the cellular effects of K1 function and the eventual role of K1 in KS, we developed a cell model for studying K1 expression. K1 was cloned from BC-3 lymphoma cells. To monitor transcriptional activation, K1 was coexpressed with plasmids containing luciferase under control of various promoters. K1 expression was monitored by indirect immunofluorescence and by combined immunoprecipitation/immunoblot analysis. Inflammatory cytokines were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cellular transfection of the K1 gene induced reporter expression under control of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB), which controls the transcription of numerous proteins involved in inflammation. Treatment of cells with aspirin, an agent that targets this intracellular pathway and blocks cell inflammatory responses, blocked K1-induced NF-kappaB-dependent promoter activity. When a second KS cofactor, i.e., the HIV-1-transactivating gene tat, was coexpressed with K1, we observed an additive effect on NF-kappaB-dependent transcription. K1 transfection stimulated the secretion of cytokines interleukin (IL) 6, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and IL-12. Cells treated with the conditioned media of K1 transfectants exhibited similar characteristics of K1 transfectants, indicating that a paracrine loop was being activated.\nQuestion: Human herpesvirus 8 K1-associated nuclear factor-kappa B-dependent promoter activity: role in Kaposi's sarcoma inflammation?", "gt": "Thus, K1 may activate cells in which it is expressed, as well as other cells in a paracrine manner. K1 cooperates in signaling with HIV-1 Tat, suggesting that both of the proteins from these viruses converge to reach an enhanced level of inflammation that may underlie progressive KS.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8), also known as Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), is implicated in the development of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), a type of cancer that causes patches of abnormal tissue to grow under the skin, in the lining of the mouth, nose, and throat, or in other organs. The K1 gene of HHV8 encodes a transmembrane protein that has a critical role in the virus's ability to cause inflammation, which is essential for the pathology of KS.\n\nThe K1 protein contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM), which is involved in signaling pathways that lead to the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB). NF-\u03baB is a protein complex that controls the transcription of DNA, cytokine production, and cell survival. In the context of HHV8 and KS, the activation of NF-\u03baB by K1 leads to the expression of genes involved in inflammation, including cytokines like interleukin (IL) 6, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and IL-12. These cytokines are important mediators of inflammation and contribute to the inflammatory environment that supports KS development.\n\nThe study mentioned in the context shows that the expression of K1 leads to increased NF-\u03baB-dependent promoter activity, which can be blocked by aspirin, an inhibitor of the NF-\u03baB pathway. Additionally, the co-expression of K1 with another KS cofactor, HIV-1 Tat, results in an additive effect on NF-\u03baB-dependent transcription, further highlighting the role of K1 in promoting inflammation.\n\nThe ability of K1 to stimulate cytokine secretion and the observation that conditioned media from K1 transfectants can induce similar characteristics in other cells suggest that K1 can activate a paracrine loop, which is a mechanism where a cell secretes a hormone or chemical messenger that binds to autocrine receptors on the same cell, or to the receptors on neighboring cells to alter their behavior. This paracrine loop likely contributes to the chronic inflammatory state seen in KS.\n\nIn summary, the K1-associated NF-\u03baB-dependent promoter activity plays a significant role in the inflammatory processes associated with Kaposi's sarcoma, likely contributing to the development and progression of the disease."}

Consecutively screening patients did not result in a sample representative of the larger pool of distressed patients, which may lower generalizability. An adequately powered intervention trial using screening requires a feasibility study establishing recruitment rates and dedicated, funded staff assistance.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the provided context, implementing screening for distress as a means to recruit patients to a psychological intervention trial, such as the one evaluating problem-solving therapy (PST), does not appear to be an efficient method. The key points that support this conclusion are:\n\n1. **Low Consent Rate**: Only 36 patients (4% of the total 970 screened) consented to participate in the trial, indicating a low conversion rate from screening to actual enrollment.\n\n2. **High Screening-to-Recruitment Ratio**: It was necessary to screen 27 patients to recruit a single participant for the trial, which suggests a significant inefficiency in the recruitment process.\n\n3. **Time Investment**: The process required 17 hours of time investment for each patient recruited, indicating that the recruitment process is time-consuming.\n\n4. **Barriers**: The context mentions that time constraints and negative attitudes of oncology staff towards screening were barriers, which further complicates the recruitment process.\n\nGiven these factors, it can be concluded that the current screening method for distress is not an efficient means to recruit patients for psychological intervention trials. The process involves a high volume of screening with a low yield of participants, and it is resource-intensive."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: The goal of this study was to examine the reasons for early readmissions within 30 days of discharge to a major academic neurosurgical service. A database of readmissions within 30 days of discharge between April 2009 and September 2010 was retrospectively reviewed. Clinical and administrative variables associated with readmission were examined, including age, sex, race, days between discharge and readmission, and insurance type. The readmissions were then assigned independently by 2 neurosurgeons into 1 of 3 categories: scheduled, adverse event, and unrelated. The adverse event readmissions were further subcategorized into patients readmitted although best practices were followed, those readmitted due to progression of their underlying disease, and those readmitted for preventable causes. These variables were compared descriptively. A total of 348 patients with 407 readmissions were identified, comprising 11.5% of the total 3552 admissions. The median age of readmitted patients was 55 years (range 16-96 years) and patients older than 65 years totaled 31%. There were 216 readmissions (53% of 407) for management of an adverse event that was classified as either preventable (149 patients; 37%) or unpreventable (67 patients; 16%). There were 113 patients (28%) who met readmission criteria but who were having an electively scheduled neurosurgical procedure. Progression of disease (48 patients; 12%) and treatment unrelated to primary admission (30 patients; 7%) were additional causes for readmission. There was no significant difference in the proportion of early readmissions by payer status when comparing privately insured patients and those with public or no insurance (p = 0.09).\nQuestion: Are readmission rates on a neurosurgical service indicators of quality of care?", "gt": "The majority of early readmissions within 30 days of discharge to the neurosurgical service were not preventable. Many of these readmissions were for adverse events that occurred even though best practices were followed, or for progression of the natural history of the neurosurgical disease requiring expected but unpredictably timed subsequent treatment. Judicious care often requires readmission to prevent further morbidity or death in neurosurgical patients, and penalties for readmission will not change these patient care obligations.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the study described, readmission rates on a neurosurgical service can provide some indicators of quality of care, but they are not the sole determinant. The study categorized readmissions into three main groups: scheduled readmissions, readmissions due to adverse events, and unrelated readmissions. Among the readmissions due to adverse events, the study further divided these into preventable and unpreventable categories. Preventable readmissions could be more directly linked to the quality of care, as they indicate situations where better care practices might have prevented the readmission. However, a significant portion of the readmissions (16%) were due to unpreventable adverse events, such as the progression of the underlying disease, which are not necessarily indicative of poor quality of care. Additionally, the study found that 28% of readmissions were for electively scheduled neurosurgical procedures, which are planned and not related to the quality of initial care. Therefore, while readmission rates can offer insights into quality of care, particularly when they are due to preventable adverse events, they must be analyzed in context, taking into account the nature of the readmission and the specific circumstances of the patients."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effects of the increased number of caesarean deliveries (CDs) in cases of multiple repeat caesarean deliveries (MRCDs) on maternal and neonatal morbidity. MRCDs admitted to our hospital between January 2013 and September 2014 were analysed retrospectively. A total number of 1133 women were included in the study and were divided into 4 groups. Group 1: second CDs (n\u2009=\u2009329); Group 2: third CDs (n\u2009=\u2009225); Group 3: fourth CDs (n\u2009=\u2009447); Group 4: fifth CDs (n\u2009=\u2009132). The clinical, demographic, intraoperative and postoperative data of the patients were registered upon the review of patient files. The differences among the groups were found to be statistically significant in terms of mean maternal age, gravida, APGAR (Activity, Pulse, Grimace, Appearance, Respiration) scores, hospital stay and operation time. In addition, the difference was also statistically significant for severe adhesion, bladder injury and premature birth. No statistically significant difference was observed among the groups with respect to placenta previa, placenta accreta, caesarean hysterectomy, uterine scar rupture.\nQuestion: Multiple repeat caesarean deliveries: do they increase maternal and neonatal morbidity?", "gt": "According to our findings, MRCDs seem to increasing the maternal and neonatal morbidity even though they are not life-threatening.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the context provided, the study examines the effects of multiple repeat caesarean deliveries (MRCDs) on both maternal and neonatal morbidity. The analysis, which involved 1133 women undergoing second, third, fourth, and fifth caesarean deliveries (CDs), revealed statistically significant differences among the groups in terms of several outcomes. These outcomes included maternal age, number of pregnancies, APGAR scores, duration of hospital stay, operation time, severe adhesion, bladder injury, and premature birth. \n\nThe statistically significant differences suggest that as the number of repeat caesarean deliveries increases, certain risks to both the mother and the newborn also increase. For instance, longer operation times and hospital stays, higher incidences of severe adhesion and bladder injury, and possibly lower APGAR scores (which can indicate neonatal health issues) point towards increased morbidity.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the study did not find a statistically significant difference among the groups when it came to more severe complications such as placenta previa, placenta accreta, caesarean hysterectomy, and uterine scar rupture. This indicates that while there may be an increase in certain types of morbidity with multiple repeat caesareans, the risk of these more severe complications does not appear to increase significantly with each additional CD.\n\nIn summary, the study suggests that multiple repeat caesarean deliveries do increase certain aspects of maternal and neonatal morbidity, but the increase is not uniform across all types of complications."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: To evaluate the perioperative and long-term results of total pancreatectomy (TP), and to assess whether it provides morbidity, mortality, and quality of life (QoL) comparable to those of the pylorus-preserving (pp)-Whipple procedure in patients with benign and malignant pancreatic disease. TP was abandoned for decades because of high peri- and postoperative morbidity and mortality. Because selected pancreatic diseases are best treated by TP, and pancreatic surgery and postoperative management of exocrine and endocrine insufficiency have significantly improved, the hesitance to perform a TP is disappearing. In a prospective study conducted from October 2001 to November 2006, all patients undergoing a TP (n = 147; 100 primary elective TP [group A], 24 elective TP after previous pancreatic resection [group B], and 23 completion pancreatectomies for complications) were included, and perioperative and late follow-up data, including the QoL (EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire), were evaluated. A matched-pairs analysis with patients receiving a pp-Whipple operation was performed. Indications for an elective TP (group A + B) were pancreatic and periampullary adenocarcinoma (n = 71), other neoplastic pancreatic tumors (intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, neuroendocrine tumors, cystic tumors; n = 34), metastatic lesions (n = 8), and chronic pancreatitis (n = 11). There were 73 men and 51 women with a mean age of 60.9 +/- 11.3 years. Median intraoperative blood loss was 1000 mL and median operation time was 380 minutes. Postoperative surgical morbidity was 24%, medical morbidity was 15%, and mortality was 4.8%. The relaparotomy rate was 12%. Median postoperative hospital stay was 11 days. After a median follow-up of 23 months, global health status of TP patients was comparable to that of pp-Whipple patients, although a few single QoL items were reduced. All patients required insulin and exocrine pancreatic enzyme replacements. The mean HbA1c value was 7.3% +/- 0.9%.\nQuestion: Is there still a role for total pancreatectomy?", "gt": "In this cohort study, mortality and morbidity rates after elective TP are not significantly different from the pp-Whipple. Because of improvements in postoperative management, QoL is acceptable, and is almost comparable to that of pp-Whipple patients. Therefore, TP should no longer be generally avoided, because it is a viable option in selected patients.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the provided context, total pancreatectomy (TP) still holds a role in the treatment of specific pancreatic diseases, despite its historical abandonment due to concerns over high perioperative and postoperative morbidity and mortality. The study indicates that TP can be performed with acceptable outcomes when considering modern surgical techniques and postoperative management strategies for the resulting exocrine and endocrine insufficiencies.\n\nThe research highlights that TP is particularly beneficial for selected patients with either benign or malignant pancreatic diseases, where it may be the most effective treatment option. This includes cases of pancreatic and periampullary adenocarcinoma, other neoplastic pancreatic tumors, metastatic lesions, and chronic pancreatitis. The study also shows that TP can be performed with a surgical morbidity rate of 24%, medical morbidity of 15%, and a mortality rate of 4.8%, which, while not negligible, are within acceptable ranges for such a major procedure.\n\nMoreover, the quality of life (QoL) outcomes for TP patients were found to be comparable to those of patients who underwent a pylorus-preserving Whipple procedure, with only minor reductions in some specific QoL items. This suggests that, despite the need for lifelong insulin and exocrine pancreatic enzyme replacement, TP can still offer patients a reasonable quality of life post-surgery.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether there is still a role for total pancreatectomy is yes, given that it can be a viable and effective surgical option for certain pancreatic conditions, with acceptable risks and outcomes, and can be performed with modern surgical and postoperative management techniques that help mitigate its historical complications."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Issues around end-of-life health care have attracted increasing attention in the last decade. One question that has arisen is whether very elderly individuals receive overly aggressive treatment at the end of life. The purpose of this study was to address this issue by examining whether health care use at the end life varies by age. The study included all adults 65 years old or older who died in Manitoba, Canada in 2000 (N = 7678). Measures were derived from administrative data files and included location of death, hospitalizations, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, long-term care (LTC) use, physician visits, and prescription drug use in the last 30 days versus 180 days before death, respectively. Individuals 85 years old or older had increased odds of being in a LTC institution and also dying there than did individuals 65-74 years old. They had, correspondingly, lower odds of being hospitalized and being admitted to an ICU. Although some statistically significant age differences emerged for physician visits, the effects were small. Prescription drug use did not vary by age.\nQuestion: Health care use at the end of life among older adults: does it vary by age?", "gt": "These findings indicate that very elderly individuals tended to receive care within LTC settings, with care that might be considered aggressive declining with increasing age.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Transurethral laser prostatectomy has evolved as a viable alternative for the management of benign prostate enlargement. Since the renaissance of laser prostatectomy with the advent of the holmium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser in the 1990s, various lasers and subsequent procedures have been introduced. These techniques can be categorized as vaporizing, resecting, and enucleating approaches. Photoselective vaporization of the prostate (PVP) is dominated by high-power lithium triborate (LBO) crystal lasers (GreenLight XPS). The mainstay of this technique is for the treatment of small to medium prostate volumes whereas enucleating techniques, such as holmium laser enucleation of the prostate and thulium enucleation of the prostate, focus on large-volume glands. In order to perspectively \"delimit\" LBO into the field of large-volume prostates, we developed LBO en bloc enucleation to render it as a competing transurethral enucleating approach. We present a detailed stepwise progressive technique developed in Madrid, Spain, for the complete removal of the transitional zone by vapoenucleation. The steps include exposition of the prostatic capsule by PVP toward the peripheral zone, thereby identifying the anatomical limits of enucleation. Subsequently, the transitional zone is excised in a single bloc and morcellated after its placement into the bladder.\nQuestion: Common trend: move to enucleation-Is there a case for GreenLight enucleation?", "gt": "This new GreenLight en bloc enucleation technique allows to treat larger prostates than those previously treated with the PVP technique.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the provided context, there is indeed a case for exploring GreenLight enucleation as a viable technique for managing large-volume prostate glands. The context outlines a progression in the use of laser technology for treating benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), starting with vaporization techniques like Photoselective Vaporization of the Prostate (PVP) using high-power lithium triborate (LBO) lasers, which are typically used for smaller to medium-sized prostates. However, for larger prostates, enucleation techniques have been preferred due to their ability to remove more tissue and potentially provide longer-lasting relief.\n\nThe development of LBO en bloc enucleation suggests that there is an interest and potential in adapting vaporization technologies, like those used in GreenLight procedures, for enucleation. This adaptation would aim to leverage the benefits of both vaporization (such as reduced bleeding) and enucleation (such as the removal of larger volumes of tissue) to treat large-volume prostates effectively.\n\nTherefore, the case for GreenLight enucleation lies in its potential to offer a minimally invasive, effective method for treating large prostates by integrating the advantages of both vaporization and enucleation techniques. This approach could provide an alternative to traditional enucleation methods, potentially reducing operative time and complications while maintaining or improving patient outcomes."}

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: To determine the effect of treatment by a cardiologist on mortality of elderly patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI, heart attack), accounting for both measured confounding using risk-adjustment techniques and residual unmeasured confounding with instrumental variables (IV) methods.DATA SOURCES/ Medical chart data and longitudinal administrative hospital records and death records were obtained for 161,558 patients aged>or =65 admitted to a nonfederal acute care hospital with AMI from April 1994 to July 1995. Our principal measure of significant cardiologist treatment was whether a patient was admitted by a cardiologist. We use supplemental data to explore whether our analysis would differ substantially using alternative definitions of significant cardiologist treatment. This retrospective cohort study compared results using least squares (LS) multivariate regression with results from IV methods that accounted for additional unmeasured patient characteristics. Primary outcomes were 30-day and one-year mortality, and secondary outcomes included treatment with medications and revascularization procedures.DATA COLLECTION/ Medical charts for the initial hospital stay of each AMI patient underwent a comprehensive abstraction, including dates of hospitalization, admitting physician, demographic characteristics, comorbid conditions, severity of clinical presentation, electrocardiographic and other diagnostic test results, contraindications to therapy, and treatments before and after AMI. Patients admitted by cardiologists had fewer comorbid conditions and less severe AMIs. These patients had a 10 percent (95 percent CI: 9.5-10.8 percent) lower absolute mortality rate at one year. After multivariate adjustment with LS regression, the adjusted mortality difference was 2 percent (95 percent CI: 1.4-2.6 percent). Using IV methods to provide additional adjustment for unmeasured differences in risk, we found an even smaller, statistically insignificant association between physician specialty and one-year mortality, relative risk (RR) 0.96 (0.88-1.04). Patients admitted by a cardiologist were also significantly more likely to have a cardiologist consultation within the first day of admission and during the initial hospital stay, and also had a significantly larger share of their physician bills for inpatient treatment from cardiologists. IV analysis of treatments showed that patients treated by cardiologists were more likely to undergo revascularization procedures and to receive thrombolytic therapy, aspirin, and calcium channel-blockers, but less likely to receive beta-blockers.\nQuestion: Does physician specialty affect the survival of elderly patients with myocardial infarction?", "gt": "In a large population of elderly patients with AMI, we found significant treatment differences but no significant incremental mortality benefit associated with treatment by cardiologists.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the provided context, the study found that the effect of physician specialty on the survival of elderly patients with myocardial infarction (AMI) is nuanced. Initially, patients admitted by cardiologists had a lower absolute mortality rate at one year, with a 10 percent reduction in mortality. However, after adjusting for measured confounders using least squares multivariate regression, the adjusted mortality difference was reduced to 2 percent. When further accounting for potential unmeasured confounders using instrumental variables (IV) methods, the association between being treated by a cardiologist and one-year mortality became statistically insignificant (relative risk [RR] 0.96, 95 percent confidence interval [CI]: 0.88-1.04).\n\nThis suggests that while there might be a perceived benefit in mortality associated with being admitted by a cardiologist, much of this association can be explained by measured and unmeasured confounding factors. Therefore, the direct impact of physician specialty on the survival of elderly patients with AMI appears to be minimal after accounting for these factors. However, the study also noted that patients treated by cardiologists were more likely to receive specific treatments such as revascularization procedures and thrombolytic therapy, which might indirectly influence survival outcomes."}

Radiotherapy treatment plans were devised for WBI and 3D-PBI for 25 consecutive patients randomized on the NSABP B-39/RTOG 0413 protocol at Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida. WBI plans were for 50 Gy in 25 fractions, and 3D-PBI plans were for 38.5 Gy in 10 fractions. Volume of ipsilateral lung receiving 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 Gy was recorded for each plan. The linear quadratic equation was used to calculate the corresponding dose delivered in 10 fractions and volume of ipsilateral lung receiving these doses was recorded for PBI plans. Ipsilateral mean lung dose was recorded for each plan and converted to BED. There was a significant decrease in volume of lung receiving 20 Gy with PBI (median, 4.4% vs. 7.5%; p<0.001), which remained after correction for fractionation (median, 5.6% vs. 7.5%; p = 0.02). Mean lung dose was lower for PBI (median, 3.46 Gy vs. 4.57 Gy; p = 0.005), although this difference lost significance after conversion to BED (median, 3.86 Gy(3) vs 4.85 Gy(3), p = 0.07).

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Statins have a well-established role in prevention of vascular events but are associated with muscle-related adverse events. The dose relationship with these adverse events is unclear. We present an original analysis of Canadian and US case reports of statin-associated rhabdomyolysis with a focus on dose response. A typical clinical case is also summarized. All cases of statin-associated rhabdomyolysis reported to Health Canada's Canadian Vigilance Program and to the US Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System from 2004-2008 were analyzed by severity and dose equivalence. Canadian national statin utilization data from 2002-2007 were used to estimate the dose-related incidence of rhabdomyolysis corrected for levels of utilization. The clinical case illustrates well the potential severity of statin-induced rhabdomyolysis. Combined Canadian/US data revealed an average of 812 cases of statin-induced rhabdomyolysis reported annually with a mean patient age of 64.4 years (35.5% female). The worst outcomes reported were renal dysfunction in 17.0%, acute renal failure in 19.8%, dialysis in 5.2%, and death in 7.6%. Using 10 mg atorvastatin per day as the reference dose, the odds ratios of rhabdomyolysis were 3.8 (95% CI 2.3-6.6) for 40 mg/day atorvastatin dose equivalent and 11.3 (95% CI 6.4-20.4) for 80 mg/day atorvastatin dose equivalent.\nQuestion: Statin-associated rhabdomyolysis: is there a dose-response relationship?", "gt": "The results of our adverse drug analysis suggest a dose-response relationship.

These mice have great importance in evaluating the function of genes. However, their utility depends on the maintenance of this true congenic nature. Although, accumulating evidence suggests that congenic strains suffer genetic divergence that could compromise interpretation of experimental results, this problem is usually ignored. During coinfection studies with Salmonella typhimurium and Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) in major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-congenic mice, we conducted the proper F2 controls and discovered significant differences between these F2 animals and MHC-genotype-matched P0 and F1 animals in weight gain and pathogen load. To systematically evaluate the apparent non-MHC differences in these mice, we infected all three generations (P0, F1 and F2) for 5 MHC genotypes (b/b, b/q and q/q as well as d/d, d/q, and q/q) with Salmonella and TMEV. Infected P0 MHC q/q congenic homozygotes lost significantly more weight (p = 0.02) and had significantly higher Salmonella (p<0.01) and TMEV (p = 0.02) titers than the infected F2 q/q homozygotes. Neither weight nor pathogen load differences were present in sham-infected controls.\nQuestion: Infection-dependent phenotypes in MHC-congenic mice are not due to MHC: can we trust congenic animals?", "gt": "These data suggest that these strains differ for genes other than those in the MHC congenic region. The most likely explanation is that deleterious recessive mutations affecting response to infection have accumulated in the more than 40 years that this B10.Q-H-2q MHC-congenic strain has been separated from its B10-H-2b parental strain. During typical experiments with congenic strains, the phenotypes of these accumulated mutations will be falsely ascribed to the congenic gene(s). This problem likely affects any strains separated for appreciable time and while usually ignored, can be avoided with the use of F2 segregants.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "The evidence presented suggests that the infection-dependent phenotypes observed in MHC-congenic mice, such as weight loss and higher pathogen loads, are not solely due to differences in the MHC genotypes. This conclusion is reached by comparing the phenotypes across different generations (P0, F1, and F2) of mice with the same MHC genotypes. Specifically, the study shows that P0 MHC q/q congenic homozygotes lost significantly more weight and had higher Salmonella and TMEV titers compared to the infected F2 q/q homozygotes, despite both groups having the same MHC genotype.\n\nThis finding indicates that there are likely other genetic factors or epigenetic differences between the P0 and F2 generations that are influencing the infection outcomes. These differences could arise from genetic divergence that occurs over time due to factors like genetic drift, inbreeding, or even environmental influences during breeding and maintenance, which can affect the overall genetic homogeneity of the congenic strains.\n\nThus, while congenic mice are invaluable tools for genetic studies, the reliability of their use in experiments is contingent upon the maintenance of their genetic purity. The results of this study suggest caution is warranted when interpreting experimental results using congenic strains, as non-MHC genetic differences may exist and could influence the outcomes. It is crucial to conduct proper controls and consider potential genetic divergence when designing and interpreting experiments involving congenic strains."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Studies of the protective effect of breastfeeding on asthma have not brought unequivocal results, and thus this issue remains controversial. Antibiotic use, known to increase asthma risk, may be involved in this relationship. The objective of this study was to assess the influence of breastfeeding duration on obesity and asthma risk in childhood and to test a mediating role of antibiotic use in infancy. A cross-sectional anthropometric and questionnaire study was conducted on 1,277 schoolchildren 8 years of age. Data on weight status, asthma, breastfeeding duration, antibiotic administration in infancy, socioeconomic status, and lifestyle were analyzed. Multivariate standard and logistic regression and mediation analyses, controlling for confounders, were applied. Total duration of breastfeeding was negatively related to the child's body mass index (p=0.038), fat percentage (p=0.030), and obesity risk (p=0.032). Dropping the variable of antibiotic use from the model made the breastfeeding duration a significant predictor of low asthma risk (p=0.027). Antibiotic treatment mediated the relationship between breastfeeding duration and asthma risk (Sobel's z=-2.61, p=0.009).\nQuestion: Is the Relationship Between Breastfeeding and Childhood Risk of Asthma and Obesity Mediated by Infant Antibiotic Treatment?", "gt": "Our findings support protective effects of longer duration of breastfeeding against obesity and asthma.

Additionally, the study found that antibiotic treatment mediated the relationship between the duration of breastfeeding and asthma risk, as indicated by Sobel's z-test (Sobel's z=-2.61, p=0.009). However, the study also found that breastfeeding duration was negatively related to the child's body mass index (BMI), fat percentage, and obesity risk, independent of antibiotic use. This suggests that while antibiotic use may mediate the relationship between breastfeeding and asthma risk, it does not necessarily mediate the relationship between breastfeeding and obesity risk."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: A better prognosis in obese patients has been described in acute coronary syndromes (ACS). However, this evidence is mostly based on retrospective studies and has provided conflicting results. No study reported cause-specific mortality according to body mass index (BMI) in ACS. We aimed to prospectively assess the impact of BMI on mortality and its specific causes in ACS patients. We included non-selected ACS patients admitted in a tertiary care coronary unit, collecting baseline characteristics, management and clinical course. Patients were stratified into five clinically meaningful BMI subgroups of<20, 20-24.9, 25-29.9, 30-35,>35 kg/m(2). The primary outcome was 1 year mortality, its causes and its association with BMI. This association was assessed by the Cox regression method. We included 2040 patients in our study with a mean age of 62.1 years. Low weight patients (BMI<20) were older, with less cardiovascular risk factors, higher prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and worse renal function. Mean follow up was 334 days. The unadjusted analysis showed lower all-cause mortality in all subgroups as compared to low weight patients. After adjusting for potential confounders, this association remained significant for patients with a BMI 20-24.9. Cardiac mortality was similar across BMI subgroups. In contrast, the adjusted analysis showed a significantly lower non-cardiac mortality in patients with a BMI 20-24.9, 25-29.9 and 30-35 as compared to low weight patients.\nQuestion: Body mass index and acute coronary syndromes: paradox or confusion?", "gt": "Baseline characteristics in ACS patients significantly differ according to their BMI status. The prognostic impact of BMI seems mostly related to extra-cardiac causes in low weight patients.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "The study on body mass index (BMI) and acute coronary syndromes (ACS) highlights a complex relationship that can be seen as both a paradox and a source of confusion. Traditionally, obesity has been viewed as a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, including ACS. However, the study suggests that within ACS patients, those with a BMI in the overweight or mildly obese range (20-24.9, 25-29.9, 30-35 kg/m\u00b2) have a lower all-cause mortality rate compared to those with a BMI less than 20 kg/m\u00b2. This finding is paradoxical because it contradicts the conventional understanding that higher BMI is associated with poorer health outcomes.\n\nThe confusion arises from the mixed evidence provided by previous retrospective studies, which have given conflicting results regarding the impact of BMI on ACS outcomes. This study, being prospective and adjusting for confounders, provides a more nuanced view. It shows that while cardiac mortality was similar across different BMI subgroups, non-cardiac mortality was notably lower in patients with a normal to slightly overweight BMI (20-24.9 kg/m\u00b2) and even in those who were overweight to mildly obese (25-29.9, 30-35 kg/m\u00b2) compared to those who were underweight.\n\nThis suggests that the relationship between BMI and ACS outcomes may not be straightforward and could be influenced by various factors not fully captured in the study, such as the presence of chronic diseases, the specific types of ACS, or the quality of medical care received. Therefore, while the study clarifies some aspects of the BMI-ACS relationship, it also points out the need for further research to fully understand these complex interactions."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Annual trends in the rate of utilisation of PHI in three different clinical categories were compared with published trends in PHI membership to assess the degree to which PHI membership predicts PHI use in Western Australia. The WA Data Linkage System was used to extract all hospital morbidity records in Western Australia from 1981 to 2001. The adjusted annual incidence rate ratio of hospitalisation as a privately insured patient versus a public (Medicare) patient was estimated using Poisson regression in each clinical category across three age groups in each year. The rate ratios were graphed as segmented trend lines and compared with published data for trends in PHI membership. The most significant changes in the use of PHI versus the public system occurred between 1981 and 1984 overall clinical categories. These changes were consistent with those documented for PHI membership. From 1992 onwards, significant changes in the trend were observed in the surgical clinical category, compared with the medical and obstetric clinical categories. Further, the trend observed in the surgical clinical category at this time was inconsistent with that documented for PHI membership.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: A direct comparison of outcomes between moderate mixed aortic valve disease (MAVD) and isolated aortic stenosis (AS) or aortic regurgitation (AR) has not been performed, making evidence-based recommendations difficult in patients with MAVD. This study sought to determine adverse event (AE) occurrence (the primary endpoint), defined as New York Heart Association functional class III/IV symptoms, aortic valve replacement, or cardiac death, and to compare AE rates between MAVD and isolated AS or AR. Asymptomatic patients were identified with moderate MAVD and an ejection fraction\u00a0\u226550% and were followed at Mayo Clinic from 1994 to 2013. Moderate MAVD was defined as a combination of moderate AS and moderate AR. Age- and sex-matched control groups were selected with isolated moderate AR (n\u00a0= 117), moderate AS (n\u00a0= 117), or\u00a0severe AS (n\u00a0= 117). At 9.1 \u00b1 4.2 years of follow-up, patients with moderate MAVD (n\u00a0= 251) had a mean age of 63 \u00b1 11 years, 73% were male, and 38% had bicuspid valve. AE occurred in 193 (77%) patients in this group, including symptom development (69%), aortic valve replacement (67%), and cardiac death (4%). Predictors of AE were older age (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.71 per decade; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.38 to 1.97 per decade; p\u00a0= 0.001), and relative wall thickness>0.42 (HR:\u00a02.01; 95% CI: 1.86 to 2.33; p\u00a0= 0.002). AE rates were similar in the MAVD and severe AS group (71% vs. 68% at 5\u00a0years; p\u00a0= 0.49), but were significantly higher compared with the moderate AS and AR groups.\nQuestion: Outcomes in Moderate Mixed\u00a0Aortic\u00a0Valve\u00a0Disease: Is it Time for a Paradigm Shift?", "gt": "MAVD patients had outcomes comparable to those with severe AS, and preserved ejection fraction and should be monitored closely for symptoms.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "The study you've described provides important insights into the outcomes of patients with moderate mixed aortic valve disease (MAVD) compared to those with isolated conditions like moderate aortic stenosis (AS) or aortic regurgitation (AR). The findings suggest a significant need for a reevaluation of current paradigms in managing MAVD, particularly due to the high incidence of adverse events (AEs) observed in this patient group.\n\nKey points from the study that support the need for a paradigm shift include:\n\n1. **High AE Rate**: The AE rate in patients with moderate MAVD was 77%, which is notably high. This includes the development of symptoms, aortic valve replacement, and cardiac death. Such a high AE rate suggests that moderate MAVD might not be as benign as previously thought, especially when compared to isolated conditions.\n\n2. **Similar AE Rates to Severe AS**: The AE rates in the MAVD group were comparable to those seen in the severe AS group, indicating that moderate MAVD might have a similar clinical impact to severe AS. This implies that the current clinical approach, which may treat moderate MAVD less aggressively than severe AS, might need to be reconsidered.\n\n3. **Significantly Higher AE Rates than Moderate Isolated Conditions**: The AE rates in MAVD were significantly higher compared to both moderate AS and AR, suggesting that the combination of stenosis and regurgitation might have a synergistic effect that worsens the clinical outcome.\n\n4. **Predictors of AE**: The study identified older age and relative wall thickness >0.42 as significant predictors of AE. This information can be used to better stratify risk in MAVD patients, potentially leading to more personalized treatment plans.\n\nGiven these findings, a paradigm shift might involve:\n\n- **More Aggressive Monitoring and Earlier Intervention**: Considering the high AE rate, a more proactive approach might be warranted, potentially involving earlier surgical or transcatheter interventions.\n- **Revised Clinical Guidelines**: Clinical guidelines may need to be updated to reflect the severity of MAVD, potentially aligning the management of moderate MAVD more closely with that of severe AS.\n- **Enhanced Patient Education and Follow-Up**: Given the high AE rate and the significant predictors identified, patient education and regular follow-up might need to be intensified to improve outcomes.\n\nIn conclusion, the study's findings indicate that the current understanding and management of moderate MAVD might be insufficient. A shift towards more aggressive monitoring and intervention strategies could be essential to improve patient outcomes."}

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: For direct laryngoscopy, we compared midline and left-molar approaches with respect to ease of intubation, using a Macintosh blade. We investigated the relationship between failure of the left-molar approach and preoperative risk factors for difficult intubation. With local ethics committee approval, 200 consecutive adult, nonpregnant patients were included in the study. The demographic data, body mass index, Mallampati modified score, interincisor gap, and mentohyoid and thyromental distances were measured preoperatively. First, the Macintosh blade was inserted using the midline approach, and then optimal external laryngeal manipulation (OELM) was applied. Second, the blade was inserted using the left-molar approach. The glottic views were assessed according to the Cormack-Lehane classification before and after OELM in both approaches. In cases where tracheal intubation failed with the left-molar approach, the midline approach was applied again and endotracheal intubation took place. The grade I glottic view obtained using the midline approach without OELM did not change in 94.3% of the patients with the left-molar approach without OELM; in addition, the grade II glottic view improved to grade I in 52.8% of the patients with the same technique (P<0.001). Although the number of patients with a grade I or II glottic view in the left-molar approach was 197, only 37 patients could be intubated using the left-molar approach. In addition, 59.5% of them were intubated at the second attempt with the left-molar approach, while the incidence of a second attempt was 1.2% with the midline approach (P<0.001). There was no correlation between the preoperative risk factors for difficult intubation and failure of the left-molar approach.\nQuestion: Left-molar approach for direct laryngoscopy: is it easy?", "gt": "Difficulty in the insertion of the endotracheal tube limits the efficacy of the left-molar approach.

Despite achieving a grade I or II glottic view in 197 patients (98.5% of the total 200 patients) with the left-molar approach, only 37 patients could be intubated using this technique. This indicates that a successful glottic view does not necessarily translate into successful intubation with the left-molar approach.\n\n2. A significantly higher proportion of patients required a second attempt for intubation with the left-molar approach (59.5%) compared to the midline approach (1.2%), with a statistically significant difference (P<0.001). This suggests that the left-molar approach is more challenging and less reliable for achieving successful intubation on the first attempt.\n\n3. The improvement in glottic view from grade II to grade I with the left-molar approach (52.8%) is noted, but this improvement does not seem to translate into a higher success rate for intubation, indicating that achieving a good view does not necessarily simplify the process of intubation.\n\nIn summary, while the left-molar approach can improve the glottic view in some cases, it is not easy to perform for direct laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation, as evidenced by the higher number of failed intubation attempts and the need for repeated attempts compared to the midline approach."}

The proposal for major reform indicates a belief that integrating robust basic science training into the clinical training is crucial for the development of comprehensive expertise in the field of urologic oncology. Therefore, the hybrid training is viewed as essential for fostering a new generation of physician scientists who can contribute effectively to both clinical practice and scientific research."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is often clinically silent in haemodialysed (HD) patients and their immune response may modulate liver damage in HCV infection. IL-10 and TGF-beta1 could play a role in this setting as, IL-10 down-regulates hepatic fibrosis, while TGF-beta1 is a pro-fibrotic cytokine.AIM: To evaluate the role of IL-10 and TGF-beta1 in HD/HCV+ patients. 71 HD/HCV+ patients (58 with normal [HD/HCV-N] and 13 with high serum transaminases [HD/HCV-H]), 40 non-uremic patients with chronic hepatitis C (HCV+), 56 HD anti-HCV- patients and 20 healthy volunteers (H). IL-10 and TGF-beta1 serum levels were assessed using ELISA tests. Liver histology was assessed by Ishak's score. IL-10 serum levels were significantly higher in HD patients, both HCV+ (3.7+/-0.4 pg/ml; p<0.01) and HCV- (3.8+/-0.8 pg/ml; p<0.05) than in non-uremic HCV patients (2.3+/-0.4 pg/ml). Among the HD/HCV+ patients, IL-10 serum levels were similar in HD/HCV-N and in HD/HCV-H patients. Among the HD/HCV+ patients, IL-10 serum levels were similar in those with moderate histological damage compared to those with mild damage. TGF-beta1 serum levels were significantly lower in HD patients, both HCV+ (4.6+/-0.9 ng/ml) and HCV- (6.0+/-0.9 ng/ml) than in non-uremic HCV+ patients (8.1+/-1.1 ng/ml; p<0.001 and p<0.01, respectively), but similar to the values found in H (5.3+/-0.9 ng/ml; p=n.s.). No correlation was seen between IL-10 and TGF-beta1 serum levels in any of the groups considered.\nQuestion: HCV infection in haemodialysed patients: a role for serum IL-10 and TGF-beta1 in liver damage?", "gt": "Patients on haemodialysis treatment to have high levels of IL-10, which remain high even when patients are anti-HCV+, whereas the opposite is true of TGF-beta1. The cytokine pattern observed in HD patients is compatible with the hypothesis explaining the relatively benign evolution of HCV-related liver disease in HD patients, and has a pathophysiological role.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the provided context, the study aimed to evaluate the role of two cytokines, IL-10 and TGF-beta1, in liver damage among hemodialysis (HD) patients who are also infected with the Hepatitis C virus (HCV+). The study compared serum levels of these cytokines among different groups: HD/HCV+ patients (further divided into those with normal transaminases and those with high transaminases), non-uremic patients with chronic hepatitis C, HD patients without HCV, and healthy volunteers.\n\nThe findings indicate that IL-10 levels were significantly higher in HD patients, regardless of HCV status, compared to non-uremic HCV patients. This suggests that IL-10 levels are elevated in the context of hemodialysis itself, and this elevation is not further increased by HCV infection. Notably, among HD/HCV+ patients, IL-10 levels did not differ between those with normal transaminase levels (indicating less liver damage) and those with high transaminase levels (indicating more liver damage). Additionally, there was no difference in IL-10 levels based on the extent of histological liver damage, as assessed by Ishak's score.\n\nRegarding TGF-beta1, which is known to promote fibrosis, the study found that its serum levels were significantly lower in HD patients (both HCV+ and HCV-) compared to non-uremic HCV+ patients. This finding suggests that the presence of hemodialysis might be associated with lower levels of this pro-fibrotic cytokine, potentially indicating a reduced risk of fibrosis in these patients compared to non-uremic HCV+ patients.\n\nThe study did not find a correlation between IL-10 and TGF-beta1 serum levels in any of the groups considered, suggesting that these cytokines may influence liver damage independently of each other.\n\nIn summary, while the study shows that both IL-10 and TGF-beta1 are influenced by the presence of hemodialysis, the data do not strongly support a direct role for these cytokines in modulating liver damage specifically in the context of HCV infection among hemodialysis patients. The lack of correlation with liver damage severity and the similar levels of IL-10 across different stages of liver damage among HD/HCV+ patients suggest that other factors may play a more significant role in the progression of liver damage in this patient population."}

Data from DATASUS (the Brazilian Unified Health Computerized System) with free access in the web were collected regarding the number of beds, the development of new community centers, the number of mental health professionals, and costs involved from 1995 to 2005. In ten years, the number of psychiatric beds decreased 41% (5.4 to 3.2 per 10,000 inhabitants) while community services have increased nine-fold (0.004 to 0.037 per 10,000 inhabitants). Psychologists and social workers have accounted for three and two-fold, respectively, as much hirings as psychiatrists. Psychiatric admissions accounted for 95.5% of the budget in 1995 and 49% in 2005, and the expenses with community services and medication have increased 15% each. As a whole, the expenses in mental health decreased by 26.7% (2.66 to 1.95 US$ per capita).\nQuestion: Is psychiatric reform a strategy for reducing the mental health budget?", "gt": "There has been a clear switch from hospital to community psychiatric care in Brazil, where the system can now provide a diversity of treatments and free access to psychotropics. However, the coverage of community services is precarious, and the reform was not accompanied by an increased public investment in mental health.

Additionally, there has been a shift in budget allocation from psychiatric admissions to community services and medication. The overall expenses in mental health have decreased by 26.7% per capita, indicating that the reform strategy has been associated with a reduction in mental health spending. Therefore, it can be inferred that psychiatric reform, as implemented in Brazil, is a strategy that aims to reduce the mental health budget while potentially improving the quality and accessibility of mental health services."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Prenatal smoking is robustly associated with increased risk of conduct problems in offspring. Observational studies that provide detailed phenotypic description are critical for generating testable hypotheses about underlying processes through which the effects of prenatal smoking may operate. To this end, we use a developmental framework to examine the association of exposure with (1) oppositional defiant disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in young boys and (2) the pattern of delinquent behavior at adolescence. Using diagnostic measures and repeated measures of delinquency, we compare exposed and nonexposed boys from the youngest cohort of the Pittsburgh Youth Study (N = 448). Exposed boys were significantly more likely to (1) develop oppositional defiant disorder and comorbid oppositional defiant disorder-attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder but not attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder alone and (2) to have an earlier onset of significant delinquent behavior.\nQuestion: Is prenatal smoking associated with a developmental pattern of conduct problems in young boys?", "gt": "The early emergence and developmental coherence of exposure-related conduct problems is striking and is consistent with a behavioral teratological model. Phenotypically, exposure-related conduct problems appear to be characterized by socially resistant and impulsively aggressive behavior.

Additionally, these boys tend to have an earlier onset of significant delinquent behavior during adolescence. This suggests a developmental trajectory where prenatal smoking exposure is linked to earlier and more severe conduct problems as the boys grow older."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Vaginal radical trachelectomy (VRT) is the most widely evaluated form of conservative management of young patients with early-stage (IB1) cervical cancer. Patients with nodal involvement or a tumor size greater than 2 cm are not eligible for such treatment. The aim of this study is to report the impact of a \"staging\" conization before VRT. This is a retrospective study of 34 patients potentially selected for VRT for a clinical and radiologic cervical tumor less than 2 cm. Among them, 28 underwent finally a VRT (20 of them having a previous conization before this procedure) and 6 patients with macroscopic cervical cancer, confirmed by punch biopsies, \"eligible\" for VRT (<2 cm) had undergone \"staging\" conization (without further VRT) to confirm the tumor size and lymphovascular space involvement (LVSI) status. Six patients having \"staging\" conization before VRT had finally been deemed contraindications to VRT due to the presence of a histologically confirmed tumor greater than 2 cm and/or associated with multiple foci of LVSI. Among 28 patients who underwent VRT, 1 received adjuvant chemoradiation (this patient recurred and died of disease). Two patients treated with RVT (without postoperative treatment) recurred. Ten pregnancies (9 spontaneous and 1 induced) were observed in 9 patients. Among 4 patients with macroscopic \"visible\" tumor who do not underwent a \"staging\" conization before VRT, 2 recurred. Among 11 patients who underwent VRT and having LVSI, 3 recurred.\nQuestion: Analysis of a continuous series of 34 young patients with early-stage cervical cancer selected for a vaginal radical trachelectomy: should \"staging\" conization be systematically performed before this procedure?", "gt": "These results suggest that if a conization is not performed initially, it should then be included among the staging procedures to select patients for VRT.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the information provided in the context, the study suggests that \"staging\" conization could play a critical role in determining the eligibility of patients for vaginal radical trachelectomy (VRT) and in assessing the risk of recurrence. Here are the key points supporting this conclusion:\n\n1. **Identification of Ineligibility**: Among the patients who underwent a \"staging\" conization, six were found to have a histologically confirmed tumor greater than 2 cm and/or multiple foci of lymphovascular space involvement (LVSI), making them ineligible for VRT. This indicates that \"staging\" conization can help identify patients who would not benefit from VRT and may need alternative treatments.\n\n2. **Recurrence Rates**: The context mentions that among 4 patients with macroscopic \"visible\" tumors who did not undergo a \"staging\" conization before VRT, 2 recurred. This suggests that without a \"staging\" conization, some patients who are not suitable for VRT might still undergo the procedure, leading to a higher recurrence rate.\n\n3. **Risk Assessment**: The study also notes that among patients who had LVSI and underwent VRT, 3 out of 11 recurred. This indicates that LVSI, which can be identified through \"staging\" conization, is a significant risk factor for recurrence.\n\n4. **Impact on Survival and Fertility**: The study highlights that 10 pregnancies were observed in 9 patients, indicating that VRT, when properly selected, can preserve fertility. However, the recurrence and mortality rates (e.g., one patient who recurred and died of disease after adjuvant chemoradiation) underscore the importance of accurate patient selection for VRT to ensure both survival and fertility benefits.\n\nGiven these points, the data from this study suggests that performing a \"staging\" conization before VRT could be beneficial in several ways:\n- It helps in accurately determining the size and extent of the tumor.\n- It allows for the identification of LVSI, which is a significant risk factor for recurrence.\n- It can prevent the unnecessary performance of VRT in patients who are not suitable candidates, thereby reducing the risk of recurrence and improving overall outcomes.\n\nTherefore, based on the findings of this study, it appears that \"staging\" conization should be systematically performed before VRT to ensure that the procedure is only carried out in patients who are likely to benefit from it."}

A retrospective chart review of all detailed anatomy ultrasounds before 24 weeks performed at the University of Kansas Medical Center from 08/23/2006 to 06/07/2012 was conducted. A complete evaluation of the fetal heart was accomplished using gray scale and spectral/color Doppler examinations. The outcomes of each pregnancy were reviewed for any diagnoses of aneuploidy.

Laparoscopic approach is believed to be superior over open approach in terms of shorter hospital stay and easier recovery. We aimed to assess feasibility and safety of open RYGBP with short stay in comparison with laparoscopic RYGBP. One hundred and ninety consecutive patients were assigned to open (n=103) or laparoscopic (n=87) RYGBP. The first 20 patients of the laparoscopic arm were excluded due to procedure learning curve. Patients were treated by a multidisciplinary team focused on successfully RYGBP with short stay (1 day). Short stay was reached by 90% of patients operated with open approach and 81% by laparoscopy (P=0.070). Discharge in the second day was reached by 97% of patients in both groups.

The expression of these proteins, among many others, is being deregulated in tumorogenesis. The aim of this study was to investigate whether cyclin E, pRb, and p21 can be used as prognostic indicators in gastric cancer. Fifty-six patients with gastric adenocarcinoma, who underwent curative resection, constituted the group of our study.

Patients were actively managed if there was a history of previous outflow tract surgery, prostate cancer, urethral strictures, neuropathy, elevated creatinine or hydronephrosis. In all, 93 men (mean age 70 years, range 40-84) with a median (range) PVR of 363 mL (250-700) were included in the study and followed for 5 (3-10) years. At presentation, the median maximum flow rate was 10.2 (3-30) mL/s and the voided volume 316 (89-714) mL. The measured PVR remained stable in 47 (51%), reduced in 27 (29%) and increased in 19 (20%) patients; 31 patients (33%) went on to transurethral resection of the prostate after a median of 30 (10-120) months, because of serum creatinine elevation (two), acute retention (seven), increasing PVR (eight) and worsening symptoms (14). Of 31 patients 25 were available for evaluation after surgery; their median PVR was 159 (0-1000) mL, flow rate 18.4 (4-37) mL/s and voided volume 321 (90-653) mL.

The objective of our study was to evaluate retrospectively selected patients who had undergone a fascial sling procedure with and without Burch colposuspension. Of a total of 390 females who underwent an incontinence operation at our department between 1990 and 1999, 56 patients had had a fascial sling plasty. A total of 50 patients (89 %) were followed for a median of 59.5 months. The median age was 60 years. 56 % of the patients displayed recurrent stress incontinence. The previous operations had been performed via a vaginal approach in 42.9 % and an abdominal approach in 57.1 %. The sling procedure used was that of Narik and Palmrich. Of the 50 patients, 14 had an additional Burch colposuspension. The continence rates (no pads) were for patients with a fascial sling procedure alone 63.9 % and for the combination of both operations 64.4 %. An improvement (1-3 pads) was seen in 27.8 % and 21.4 %, respectively. No changes were seen in 5.6 % and 7.1 % and impairment was seen in 2.7 % and 7.1 %, respectively.

The continence rates (no pads) for patients with a fascial sling procedure alone were 63.9%, and for those who had both procedures, it was 64.4%. These rates are very close, suggesting that the addition of the Burch colposuspension does not significantly improve continence outcomes. Additionally, the overall patient satisfaction rate after a five-year follow-up was 78%, which does not indicate a substantial difference between the two procedures in terms of patient satisfaction. Therefore, based on this study, there is no clear evidence that a combined fascial sling - Burch colposuspension displays advantages over a fascial sling alone for the treatment of urinary stress incontinence in females."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Despite significant risk for venous thromboembolism, severely injured trauma patients often are not candidates for prophylaxis or treatment with anticoagulation. Long-term inferior vena cava (IVC) filters are associated with increased risk of postphlebitic syndrome. Retrievable IVC filters potentially offer a better solution, but only if the filter is removed; our hypothesis is that the most of them are not. This retrospective study queried a level I trauma registry for IVC filter insertion from September 1997 through June 2004. One IVC filter was placed before the availability of retrievable filters in 2001. Since 2001, 27 filters have been placed, indicating a change in practice patterns. Filters were placed for prophylaxis (n = 11) or for therapy in patients with pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis (n = 17). Of 23 temporary filters, only 8 (35%) were removed.\nQuestion: Are temporary inferior vena cava filters really temporary?", "gt": "Surgeons must critically evaluate indications for IVC filter insertion, develop standard criteria for placement, and implement protocols to ensure timely removal of temporary IVC filters.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the information provided, the answer is that temporary inferior vena cava (IVC) filters, which are also referred to as retrievable IVC filters, are not always removed, thus questioning their temporary nature. The study indicates that out of 23 temporary filters placed, only 8 (35%) were actually removed. This suggests that a significant proportion of these filters remain in place longer than intended, potentially becoming de facto permanent implants. This outcome challenges the concept of these devices being truly temporary, as a substantial number are not retrieved."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: To evaluate sympathetic system activity in bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis (BPS/IC) patients and to investigate if chronic adrenergic stimulation in intact rats induces BPS/IC-like bladder modifications. Clinical study--In BPS/IC patients and aged and body mass index matched volunteers TILT test was undertaken and catecholamines were measured in plasma and 24\u2009hr urine samples. Experimental study--Phenylephrine was injected subcutaneously (14 days) to female Wistar rats. Pain behavior, spinal Fos expression, urinary spotting, number of fecal pellets expelled, frequency of reflex bladder contractions, and urothelial height were analyzed. Urothelium permeability was investigated by trypan blue staining. Immunoreactivity against caspase 3 and bax were studied in the urothelium and against alpha-1-adrenoreceptor and TRPV1 in suburothelial nerves. Mast cell number was determined in the sub-urothelium. In rats with lipopolysaccharide-induced cystitis, urinary catecholamines, and Vesicular Monoamine Transporter 2 (VMAT2) expression in bladder nerves were analyzed. The TILT test showed an increase of sympathetic activity. Noradrenaline levels in blood at resting conditions and in 24-hr urine samples were higher in BPS/IC patients. Phenylephrine administration increased visceral pain, spinal Fos expression, bladder reflex activity, urinary spotting and the number of expelled fecal pellets. The mucosa showed urothelial thinning and increased immunoreactivity for caspase 3 and bax. Trypan blue staining was only observed in phenylephrine treated animals. Suburothelial nerves co-expressed alpha1 and TRPV1. Mastocytosis was present in the suburothelium. Cystitis increased sympathetic nerve density and urinary noradrenaline levels.\nQuestion: Can the adrenergic system be implicated in the pathophysiology of bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis?", "gt": "Excessive adrenergic stimulation of the bladder may contribute to the pathophysiological mechanisms of BPS/IC.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the provided context, the adrenergic system can indeed be implicated in the pathophysiology of bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis (BPS/IC). This conclusion is supported by several key findings:\n\n1. **Increased Sympathetic Activity in BPS/IC Patients**: The TILT test, which evaluates sympathetic nervous system activity, showed an increase in sympathetic activity in BPS/IC patients compared to controls. This suggests that sympathetic overactivity is a feature of BPS/IC.\n\n2. **Elevated Noradrenaline Levels**: The context mentions higher levels of noradrenaline (a sympathetic neurotransmitter) in both blood and 24-hour urine samples of BPS/IC patients, indicating an elevated adrenergic activity in these patients.\n\n3. **Experimental Study Findings**: The experimental study in rats where phenylephrine (a sympathomimetic agent) was administered subcutaneously for 14 days resulted in several BPS/IC-like bladder modifications. These included increased visceral pain, spinal Fos expression (indicating increased neuronal activity), bladder reflex activity, urinary spotting, and changes in urothelial structure and function.\n\n4. **Neurochemical Changes**: In the experimental model, there was an increase in the immunoreactivity for caspase 3 and bax in the urothelium, suggesting enhanced apoptosis or cell death, which could contribute to bladder dysfunction. Additionally, the presence of mastocytosis in the suburothelium, and the co-expression of alpha-1-adrenoreceptor and TRPV1 in suburothelial nerves, points to a complex interaction between adrenergic and nociceptive pathways.\n\n5. **Sympathetic Nerve Density and Urinary Noradrenaline**: The finding that cystitis increased sympathetic nerve density and urinary noradrenaline levels further supports the involvement of the adrenergic system in the pathophysiology of BPS/IC.\n\nOverall, these findings suggest that chronic adrenergic stimulation and sympathetic overactivity play a significant role in the pathophysiology of BPS/IC, potentially contributing to the development of bladder dysfunction and pain."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Laparoscopic donor nephrectomy has become the standard of care in many renal transplant centers. Many centers are reluctant to perform right laparoscopic donor nephrectomies, primarily due to concerns about transplanting a kidney with a short renal vein. A retrospective review of 26 right and 24 left consecutive donor nephrectomies and their recipients was performed. Patient demographics, preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative data were recorded and compared. Patient demographics were similar between groups. Multiple vessels were encountered more frequently on the right side (10 vs. 3, p = 0.04) and the donated kidney had lesser preoperative function in the right group as determined by nuclear medicine imaging (46.5% vs. 49.4%, p<0.001).

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Prior studies have shown that age \u226570 years is associated with more aggressive non-endometrioid histology and worse survival in endometrial cancer. The purpose of this study is to assess if age is an independent poor prognostic factor in endometrioid histologies. Under an IRB-approved protocol, we identified patients with surgical stage I to II endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma from 1995 to 2008 at two institutions. Patients were divided into two groups based on age at diagnosis: Group A (age 50-69 years) and Group B (age\u226570 years). All patients underwent hysterectomy, bilateral salpingoophorectomy, +/-pelvic/aortic lymphadenectomy and adjuvant therapy. Prognostic factors were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses. We identified 338 patients with stage IA to IIB endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma. The median age in Group A was 59 years (range 50-69) and Group B was 75 years (range 70-92). Patients in Group B were more likely to have hypertension (51% vs. 68%, p=0.006) and coronary artery disease (9% vs. 18%, p=0.03). There were no differences in progression-free or disease-specific survival, however, Group B had a worse overall survival (OS) (50.1 vs. 62.6 months, p=0.03). On univariate analysis, age (p=0.04), grade (p=0.006), and coronary artery disease (p=0.01) were associated with worse OS. After adjusting for grade and coronary artery disease, age was no longer a significant variable for OS (p=0.17).\nQuestion: Is older age a poor prognostic factor in stage I and II endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma?", "gt": "After adjusting for other poor prognostic factors, age \u226570 years alone may not be a significant variable affecting overall survival in patients with early stage endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the information provided, older age (\u226570 years) was initially associated with worse overall survival (OS) in stage I and II endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma when evaluated through univariate analysis.

This suggests that while older age may be correlated with worse outcomes, its impact on prognosis is confounded by other health conditions and tumor characteristics. Therefore, in the context of this study, older age itself does not independently predict worse survival in this patient population with endometrioid histologies."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Inguinal hernia repair, hydrocelectomy, and orchidopexy are commonly performed surgical procedures in children. Postoperative pain control is usually provided with a single-shot caudal block. Blockade of the ilioinguinal nerve may lead to additional analgesia. The aim of this double-blind, randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the efficacy of an adjuvant blockade of the ilioinguinal nerve using ultrasound (US) guidance at the end of the procedure with local anesthetic vs normal saline and to explore the potential for prolongation of analgesia with decreased need for postoperative pain medication. Fifty children ages 1-6 years scheduled for unilateral inguinal hernia repair, hydrocelectomy, orchidopexy, or orchiectomy were prospectively randomized into one of two groups: Group S that received an US-guided ilioinguinal nerve block with 0.1 ml x kg(-1) of preservative-free normal saline and Group B that received an US-guided nerve block with 0.1 ml x kg(-1) of 0.25% bupivacaine with 1 : 200,000 epinephrine at the conclusion of the surgery. After induction of anesthesia but prior to surgical incision, all patients received caudal anesthesia with 0.7 ml x kg(-1) of 0.125% bupivacaine with 1 : 200,000 epinephrine. Patients were observed by a blinded observer for (i) pain scores using the Children and Infants Postoperative Pain Scale, (ii) need for rescue medication in the PACU, (iii) need for oral pain medications given by the parents at home. Forty-eight patients, consisting of 46 males and two females, with a mean age of 3.98 (SD +/- 1.88) were enrolled in the study. Two patients were excluded from the study because of study protocol violation and/or alteration in surgical procedure. The average pain scores reported for the entire duration spent in the recovery room for the caudal and caudal/ilioinguinal block groups were 1.92 (SD +/- 1.59) and 1.18 (SD +/- 1.31), respectively. The average pain score difference was 0.72 (SD +/- 0.58) and was statistically significant (P<0.05). In addition, when examined by procedure type, it was found that the difference in the average pain scores between the caudal and caudal/ilioinguinal block groups was statistically significant for the inguinal hernia repair patients (P<0.05) but not for the other groin surgery patients (P = 0.13). For all groin surgery patients, six of the 23 patients in the caudal group and eight of the 25 patients in the caudal/ilioinguinal block group required pain rescue medications throughout their entire hospital stay or at home (P = 0.76). Overall, the caudal group received an average of 0.54 (SD +/- 1.14) pain rescue medication doses, while the caudal/ilioinguinal block group received an average of 0.77 (SD +/- 1.70) pain rescue medication doses; this was, however, not statistically significant (P = 0.58).\nQuestion: Unilateral groin surgery in children: will the addition of an ultrasound-guided ilioinguinal nerve block enhance the duration of analgesia of a single-shot caudal block?", "gt": "The addition of an US-guided ilioinguinal nerve block to a single-shot caudal block decreases the severity of pain experienced by pediatric groin surgery patients.

This suggests that the additional block may provide some benefit in terms of pain management. However, the need for rescue medication in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) or at home did not significantly differ between the two groups, indicating that the addition of the ilioinguinal nerve block did not substantially reduce the overall need for postoperative pain medication.\n\nTherefore, while the ultrasound-guided ilioinguinal nerve block appears to have a positive impact on pain scores, it does not significantly extend the duration of analgesia to the point of markedly reducing the need for additional pain medications postoperatively."}

Diagnosis of active acromegaly was established on the basis of widely recognized criteria. In each patient glucose and insulin concentrations were assessed when fasting and during the 75 g OGTT. Normoglycaemia existed in 46% of acromegalic patients. Among glucose tolerance abnormalities we found impaired fasting glucose in 19%, impaired glucose tolerance in 15% and overt diabetes mellitus in 20%. There was no statistically significant differences in gender, duration of the disease, basal plasma GH, IGF-1 or fasting insulin concentrations between normoglycaemic patients and those with impairments in glucose tolerance.

Information regarding the impact of histology on outcome in childhood HD is scarce. This study determines the effect of histology on the overall survival (OS) or progression-free survival (PFS) in a national series of children treated in a standardized manner. The results of treatment of 331 assessable patients, treated between January 1, 1982 and June 30, 1992, in the United Kingdom Children's Cancer Study Group (UKCCSG) Hodgkin's study I were reviewed to evaluate OS, PFS, and deaths according to stage and histology. Treatment was either involved-field radiation alone (stage IA) or chlorambucil, vinblastine, procarbazine, and prednisolone (ChlVPP) chemotherapy with or without mediastinal radiation. All were clinically staged at diagnosis. Nodular sclerosing (NS) HD was the most common histologic subtype (155 of 331 patients [47%]) and was uniformly distributed through all stages. Lymphocyte-depletion (LD) HD was extremely uncommon (<1%). Mixed-cellularity (MC) HD had the highest relapse rate, but this was only significant (P<.05) in stage I patients who received local irradiation alone.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency and familial hypercholesterolemia are inherited disorders of metabolism that are associated with premature development of cardiovascular disease. This study addresses the possibility that different patterns of carotid wall damage and cerebral blood flow hemodynamics are present in these two metabolic diseases. Twelve patients with homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency (mean age, 24 years), 10 patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (mean age, 26 years), and 11 healthy control subjects (mean age, 26 years) underwent a vascular examination by noninvasive methods. B-mode ultrasound imaging was used to obtain measurements of intima-media thickness of common carotid, bifurcation, and internal carotid arteries as an index of atherosclerosis. Cerebral blood flow velocity was estimated from vascular examination of the middle cerebral artery by transcranial Doppler. Systolic, diastolic, and mean velocities were measured. Pulsatility index, a possible indicator of vascular resistance in the cerebral circulation, was also calculated. Mean maximum intima-media thickness was 1.4 mm in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia, 0.6 mm in patients with homocystinuria, and 0.6 mm in control subjects. The difference between hypercholesterolemic and homocystinuric patients or control subjects was statistically significant (P<.001). Diastolic blood flow velocities were significantly reduced in the middle cerebral arteries of hypercholesterolemic patients compared with homocystinuric patients or control subjects (P<.05), whereas systolic or mean velocities did not differ. The pulsatility index, a possible indicator of vascular resistance in the cerebral circulation, was significantly higher in hypercholesterolemic patients compared with homocystinuric patients or healthy control subjects (P<.01).

They are similar to healthy control subjects with regard to both intima-media thickness and blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery.

We wanted to assess the incidence of LA thrombus in these patients and to identify factors associated with its presence. Consecutive patients referred for CPVA from 2004 to 2009 underwent TEE within 48 h prior to the procedure. Of 408 patients included in the study, 6 patients (1.47%) had LA thrombi, persistent AF, and LA dilation. Compared with patients without thrombus, these six patients had larger LA diameter (P = 0.0001) and more frequently were women (P = 0.002), had persistent AF (P = 0.04), and had underlying structural cardiac disease (P = 0.014). The likelihood of presenting LA thrombus increased with the number of these four risk factors present (P<0.001). None of the patients with paroxysmal AF and without LA dilation had LA thrombus.

The decline in GFR>1 year post-OLT did not exceed the decline of 0.5-0.8 mL/min per year reported in the general population. Declines faster than 3 mL/min per year, which occurred no more frequently among patients than in the general population, seemed attributable to coexistent vascular risk factors.\nQuestion: Long-term renal function deteriorates at a similar rate among liver transplant patients with preserved renal function at 1 year and in the general population: is chronic calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity overrated?", "gt": "Among OLT patients with preserved renal function at 1 year posttransplant, our findings challenge the clinical impact of chronic progressive CNI nephrotoxicity and highlight the importance of a tight control of blood pressures, glucose and lipid levels, and other modifiable risk factors in order to preserve long-term renal function.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the provided context, it appears that chronic calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) nephrotoxicity may be overrated in terms of its impact on the long-term decline of renal function among liver transplant patients who have preserved renal function at one year post-transplant. The study indicates that the annual decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) among these patients was 0.2 mL/min per year, which is within the range of the natural decline reported in the general population (0.5-0.8 mL/min per year). Furthermore, the decline rate was not influenced by the use of maintenance-dose CNIs, as evidenced by the lack of correlation with CNI blood levels. The faster declines in GFR, which were observed in a small subset of patients, seemed to be more closely associated with the presence of vascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia, rather than CNI use. Therefore, the data suggest that the role of chronic CNI nephrotoxicity in the long-term decline of renal function among liver transplant patients with preserved renal function at one year might be less significant than previously thought."}

A prospective study conducted in the ER of Rabta university teaching hospital of Tunis, from March 1st to June 20th 2010, involving 30 consecutive patients presenting to the emergency for AD. All patients underwent echocardiography in their acute phase and benefited from the dosage of BNP during the first 4 hours. The echocardiography parameters were collected by a single operator who was unaware of the results of the BNP dosage. The mean age of patients was 72.8years with a sex ratio of 1.5. AD was of orthopnea type in 9 cases and stage III NYHA dyspnea in the other patients. Clinical and radiological signs of left heart failure were noted in 30% of cases. Ultrasound data have objectified systolic dysfunction in 4 cases, diastolic in 3 cases and systolic plus diastolic in 10 cases. The BNP levels were below 100 pg/ml in 10 cases with pulmonary origin of the AD. A BNP level between 100 and 400 pg/ml was noted in 3 cases. In our study, the clinical probability of AHF prior to performing the test was estimated at 53% and estimated at 100% after the BNP assay.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Childhood-onset schizophrenia (COS) is a severe form of the adult-onset disorder with a high rate of premorbid developmental abnormalities. Early symptoms of pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) have been reported in five independent studies of COS. In this study, we compared evidence for premorbid PDD as a nonspecific manifestation of impaired neurodevelopment seen in schizophrenia, or as an independent risk factor for COS. Diagnosis of past or current autism or PDD was made according to the DSM-IV criteria. COS patients with and without PDD were compared with respect to neuropsychological, clinical, and neurobiological measures. Several candidate genes for autism were examined in the entire COS sample and the subgroup with PDD using the Transmission Disequilibrium Test (TDT) and Quantitative TDT (QTDT). Nineteen (25%) of COS probands had a lifetime diagnosis of PDD: one met criteria for autism, two for Asperger's disorder, and 16 for PDD not otherwise specified. Premorbid social impairment was most common feature for COS-PDD subjects. The PDD group did not differ from the rest of the COS sample with respect to age of onset, IQ, response to medications, and rate of familial schizotypy. Unexpectedly, two siblings of COS-PDD probands met criteria for nuclear autism. There was no difference between PDD and non-PDD groups with respect to initial brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures. However, rate of gray matter loss was greater for PDD (n = 12) than for the non-PDD (n = 27) subgroup (-19.5 +/- 11.3 mL/year vs. -9.6 +/- 15.3 mL/year; p =.05).

This conclusion is supported by the observation that 25% of COS patients had a lifetime diagnosis of PDD, with social impairment being a common feature among those with COS and PDD. Additionally, the study found that the rate of gray matter loss was greater in the PDD subgroup compared to the non-PDD subgroup, indicating a potentially distinct neurobiological pathway.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Most of the studies on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in menopause have focused on serum lipid(lipoprotein) abnormalities and were conducted in populations which were not well controlled for several important influential factors. Two homogenous groups of 30 apparently healthy Caucasian premenopausal women and 3-5 years postmenopausal women who were nonobese, nonsmoking and not using estrogen were compared in a well-controlled cross-sectional design. Fasting serum ferritin and plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) were evaluated concomitantly to classical serum lipid(lipoprotein) risk factors. Relationships between risk factors and the influence of other contributing variables such as diet and body weight were also examined. Serum total cholesterol (p<0.01), low-density lipoproteins (LDL; p<0.05) and triglycerides (p<0.05) of postmenopausal women were greater than that of their menstruating counterparts, even though they ate a CVD-preventive diet, had similar body weight and body fat distribution. Their serum ferritin was almost 3-fold greater (p<0.0001) but was still within normal limits, except for the 38.5% of postmenopausal women who exhibited values above the 80 mug/l limit that has been associated with sharp increases in the rate of heart disease in either gender. Serum ferritin was low in one third of the postmenopausal group (as low as in the premenopausal control group, whose dietary iron intake was slightly below the nutritional recommendation). The mean plasma tHcy of the postmenopausal group was almost twice as elevated (p<0.0001). Both ferritin and tHcy were found to be linked to serum cholesterol.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Percutaneous transluminal treatment of a thrombotic vein graft yields poor results. We have previously reported our experience with transluminal percutaneous coronary ultrasound thrombolysis (CUT) in the setting of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). This report describes the first experience with ultrasound thrombolysis in thrombus-rich lesions in saphenous vein grafts (SVGs), most of which were occluded. The patients (n=20) were mostly male (85%), aged 64+/-4 years old. The presenting symptom was AMI in 2 patients (10%) and unstable angina in the rest. Fifteen patients (75%) had totally occluded SVGs. The median age of clots was 6 days (range, 0 to 100 days). The ultrasound thrombolysis device has a 1.6-mm-long tip and fits into a 7F guiding catheter over a 0.014-in guidewire in a \"rapid-exchange\" system. CUT (41 kHz, 18 W,</=6 minutes) led to device success in 14 (70%) of the patients and residual stenosis of 65+/-28%. Procedural success was obtained in 13 (65%) of the patients, with a final residual stenosis of 5+/-8%. There was a low rate of device-related adverse events: 1 patient (5%) had a non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, and distal embolization was noted in 1 patient (5%).

The use of CUT in this setting resulted in device success in 70% of the patients, with procedural success achieved in 65% of cases. These outcomes suggest that ultrasound thrombolysis can effectively address thrombus-rich lesions in SVGs, even when the grafts are occluded.\n\nThe residual stenosis after the procedure was notably reduced to 5% on average, which is a positive outcome. Additionally, the low rate of device-related adverse events, such as non-Q-wave myocardial infarction and distal embolization, occurring in only 5% of patients each, indicates that the procedure is relatively safe. However, the necessity of adjunct percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or stenting in all patients suggests that ultrasound thrombolysis alone may not be sufficient to fully resolve the occlusion without additional interventions.\n\nIn conclusion, while the challenge of treating occluded SVGs is significant, ultrasound thrombolysis can be a viable and effective method when used in conjunction with other interventions, such as PTCA or stenting.

This suggests that older adults with diabetes mellitus are indeed at a higher risk for all-cause mortality when depression is present."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: The vast majority of pancreatic cancers occurs sporadically. The discovery of frequent variations in germline gene copy number can significantly influence the expression levels of genes that predispose to pancreatic adenocarcinoma. We prospectively investigated whether patients with sporadic pancreatic adenocarcinoma share specific gene copy number variations (CNVs) in their germline DNA. DNA samples were analyzed from peripheral leukocytes from 72 patients with a diagnosis of sporadic pancreatic adenocarcinoma and from 60 controls using Affymetrix 500K array set. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) assay was performed using a set of self-designed MLPA probes specific for seven target sequences. We identified a CNV-containing DNA region associated with pancreatic cancer risk. This region shows a deletion of 1 allele in 36 of the 72 analyzed patients but in none of the controls. This region is of particular interest since it contains the YTHDC2 gene encoding for a putative DNA/RNA helicase, such protein being frequently involved in cancer susceptibility. Interestingly, 82.6% of Sicilian patients showed germline loss of one allele.\nQuestion: Germline copy number variation in the YTHDC2 gene: does it have a role in finding a novel potential molecular target involved in pancreatic adenocarcinoma susceptibility?", "gt": "Our results suggest that the YTHDC2 gene could be a potential candidate for pancreatic cancer susceptibility and a useful marker for early detection as well as for the development of possible new therapeutic strategies.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the context provided, the germline copy number variation (CNV) in the YTHDC2 gene does indeed suggest a potential role in identifying a novel molecular target involved in pancreatic adenocarcinoma susceptibility.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Natriuretic peptides (NP) are well-established markers of heart failure (HF). During the past 5 years, analytical and clinical recommendations for measurement of these biomarkers have been published in guidelines. The aim of this follow-up survey was to investigate how well these guidelines for measurement of NP have been implemented in laboratory practice in Europe. Member societies of the European Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine were invited in 2009 to participate in a web-based audit questionnaire. The questionnaire requested information on type of tests performed, decision limits for HF, turn-around time and frequency of testing. There was a moderate increase (12%) of laboratories measuring NP compared to the initial survey in 2006. The most frequently used HF decision limits for B-type NP (BNP) and N-terminal BNP (NT-proBNP) were, respectively, 100 ng/L and 125 ng/L, derived from the package inserts in 55%. Fifty laboratories used a second decision limit. Age or gender dependent decision limits were applied in 10% (8.5% in 2006).

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Edema surrounding the medial collateral ligament (MCL) is seen on MR imaging in patients with MCL injuries and in patients with radiographic osteoarthritis in the non-traumatic knee. Because we noted MCL edema in patients without prior trauma or osteoarthritis, we studied the association between intra-articular pathology and MCL edema in patients without knee trauma. We evaluated the MR examinations of 247 consecutive patients (121 male, 126 female with a mean age of 44 years) without recent trauma for the presence of edema surrounding the MCL, meniscal and ACL tears, medial meniscal extrusion, medial compartment chondromalacia, and osteoarthritis. The percentages of patients illustrating MCL edema with and without each type of pathology were compared using Fisher's exact test to determine if there was a statistically significant association. We found MCL edema in 60% of 247 patients. MCL edema was present in 67% of patients with medial meniscal tears, 35% with lateral meniscal tears, 100% with meniscal extrusion of 3 mm or more, 78% with femoral chondromalacia, 82% with tibial chondromalacia, and 50% with osteoarthritis. The percentage of patients with edema increased with the severity of the chondromalacia. These associations were all statistically significant (p<0.02). The mean age of those with MCL edema was 49.7 years compared with 34.9 years without MCL edema ( p<0.001). Patient gender and ACL tear did not correlate with MCL edema.

Educational interventions based on small groups led by facilitators have been shown to alter the consultation behaviours of general practitioners that are known to be related to accurate detection of psychological distress.AIM: This controlled study aimed to show that, by utilizing a brief self-directed educational intervention focusing on detection of psychological distress, general practitioners can improve their performance significantly. For this purpose, a new educational intervention was designed: the second aim of the study was thus to assess the effectiveness of this specific intervention. An educational intervention was designed which focused on skills relevant to detecting psychological distress, using the principles of reflection on general practitioner performance and consultation skill work. It was designed to be used by individual general practitioners without outside support, using a combination of written background material, feedback on performance and analysis of video material. The effectiveness of the intervention was tested by comparing a trial and control cohort of general practitioners, using detection rates as an outcome measure. The detection rate of the general practitioners who underwent the intervention improved significantly compared with their performance before intervention and with that of the control group.\nQuestion: Detecting psychological distress: can general practitioners improve their own performance?", "gt": "General practitioners can improve their ability to detect psychological distress in their patients utilizing this self-directed educational approach.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Yes, general practitioners can improve their own performance in detecting psychological distress.

Quasi-experimental study: a series of ten cases followed for a month. The devices were placed and the questionnaires filled in before and after using it for at least ten hours a day during a month. Health related quality of life was assessed through the questionnaires for IU convalidated and adapted to our specific environment: Urogenital Inventory Distress (UDI) and Incontinence Impact Questionary (IIQ). An improvement of 58 points by a four option Likert scale was considered a positive impact in the quality of life (IIQ). The scores obtained in UDI and IIQ are described before and after use the device and paried T test and Wilcoxon sign test were carried out to compare the scores obtained in each instance. The capacity to detect a difference of 58 points on the UDI scale was calculated (minimum relevant difference).

The 2009 men who attended for ultrasound scans of the abdominal aorta completed a short prescreening questionnaire about their perception of their general health. Four hundred and ninety-eight men (157 with an AAA and 341 with a normal aorta) were sent two questionnaires for completion 12 months after screening, one for themselves and one for their partner, each being about the quality of life of the respondent. Men with an AAA were more limited in performing physical activities than those with a normal aorta (t-test of means P = 0.04). After screening, men with an AAA were significantly less likely to have current pain or discomfort than those with a normal aorta (multivariate odds ratio: 0.5; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.3-0.9) and reported fewer visits to their doctor.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Cytoblocks (CBs), or cell blocks, provide additional morphological detail and a platform for immunocytochemistry (ICC) in cytopathology. The Cellient(\u2122) system produces CBs in 45\u00a0minutes using methanol fixation, compared with traditional CBs, which require overnight formalin fixation. This study compares Cellient and traditional CB methods in terms of cellularity, morphology and immunoreactivity, evaluates the potential to add formalin fixation to the Cellient method for ICC studies and determines the optimal sectioning depth for maximal cellularity in Cellient CBs. One hundred and sixty CBs were prepared from 40 cytology samples (32 malignant, eight benign) using four processing methods: (A) traditional; (B) Cellient (methanol fixation); (C) Cellient using additional formalin fixation for 30\u00a0minutes; (D) Cellient using additional formalin fixation for 60\u00a0minutes. Haematoxylin and eosin-stained sections were assessed for cellularity and morphology. ICC was assessed on 14 cases with a panel of antibodies. Three additional Cellient samples were serially sectioned to determine the optimal sectioning depth. Scoring was performed by two independent, blinded reviewers. For malignant cases, morphology was superior with Cellient relative to traditional CBs (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Cellularity was comparable across all methods. ICC was excellent in all groups and the addition of formalin at any stage during the Cellient process did not influence the staining quality.

Here are the key points that support this assessment:\n\n1. **Faster**: The Cellient system completes the process of producing CBs in 45 minutes, using methanol fixation, which is significantly faster than the traditional method that requires overnight formalin fixation.\n\n2. **Better Morphology**: For malignant cases, the morphology was found to be superior with Cellient-produced CBs compared to traditional CBs (P < 0.001). This suggests that the Cellient method may provide clearer and more detailed morphological features, which is crucial for accurate diagnosis and analysis in cytopathology.\n\n3. **Equivalent Cellularity**: The cellularity, or the density of cells in the CBs, was comparable across all methods tested. This means that the Cellient method does not compromise on cell density, maintaining a critical aspect of CB quality.\n\n4. **Stronger Immunoreactivity**: The immunocytochemistry (ICC) results were excellent across all groups, and the addition of formalin at any stage during the Cellient process did not affect the staining quality. This indicates that the Cellient method not only preserves cell morphology but also maintains the integrity of cellular proteins necessary for ICC, a crucial diagnostic tool in cytopathology.\n\n5. **Optimized Sectioning Depth**: The study also determined that the optimal sectioning depth for maximal cellularity in Cellient CBs is between 30-40 \u03bcm, which allows for at least 27 sections to be obtained.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Cardiac troponin I (CTnI) has been shown to be a marker of myocardial injury. The aim of this prospective, randomized study was to compare intermittent antegrade warm cardioplegia with tepid blood cardioplegia in patients undergoing first elective coronary artery bypass graft, using CTnI release as the criterion for evaluating the adequacy of myocardial protection. Seventy patients were randomly assigned to one of two cardioplegia groups. CTnI concentrations were measured in serial venous blood samples drawn immediately before cardiopulmonary bypass and after aortic unclamping at 6, 9, 12, and 24 hours. Analysis of covariance with repeated measures was performed to test the effect of the type of cardioplegia and time on CTnI concentration. The total amount of CTnI released (8.23 +/- 20.5 microg in the warm group and 3.19 +/- 2.4 microg in the tepid group) was not statistically different (p = 0.23). The CTnI concentration did not differ for any sample in either of the two groups when adjusted on ejection fraction and the number of preoperative myocardial infarctions (p = 0.06).

This study was conducted to evaluate and compare the effect of the anatomic locations of primary melanoma on long-term clinical outcomes. All consecutive cutaneous melanoma patients (n=2,079) who underwent selective SLN dissection (SLND) from 1993 to 2009 in a single academic tertiary-care medical center were included. SLN positive rate, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) were determined. Kaplan-Meier survival, univariate, and multivariate analyses were performed to determine predictive factors for SLN status, DFS, and OS. Head and neck melanoma (HNM) had the lowest SLN-positive rate at 10.8% (16.8% for extremity and 19.3% for trunk; P=0.002) but had the worst 5-year DFS (P<0.0001) and 5-year OS (P<0.0001) compared with other sites. Tumor thickness (P<0.001), ulceration (P<0.001), HNM location (P=0.001), mitotic rate (P<0.001), and decreasing age (P<0.001) were independent predictive factors for SLN-positivity.

Protocol A: After intravenous infusion of contrast media into six rabbits, alterations of potassium ion concentrations were measured. Protocol B: Fresh rabbit blood was mixed in vitro with contrast media, and the fluctuations in potassium were monitored over a 30-minute period. Protocol C: Similar to protocol B, except that blood from humans with no reaction to contrast media was used. For protocol A, blood potassium levels increased above baseline levels. The elevations were statistically significant (P<.05). For protocol B, diatrizoate and ioxaglate caused a gradual increase in blood potassium levels, but iopamidol did not.

This study aimed to develop a prognostic model for fast-breathing pneumonia treatment failure in sub-Saharan Africa. We prospectively followed a cohort of children (2-59 months), diagnosed by community health workers with fast-breathing pneumonia using World Health Organisation (WHO) integrated community case management guidelines. Cases were followed at days 5 and 14 by study data collectors, who assessed a range of pre-determined clinical features for treatment outcome. We built the prognostic model using eight pre-defined parameters, using multivariable logistic regression, validated through bootstrapping. We assessed 1,542 cases of which 769 were included (32% ineligible; 19% defaulted). The treatment failure rate was 15% at day 5 and relapse was 4% at day 14.

Herein, we present survival data from the largest available database on transplanted hereditary TTR patients to serve as a base for comparison. Liver transplantation was evaluated in a 20-year retrospective analysis of the Familial Amyloidosis Polyneuropathy World Transplant Registry. From April 1990 until December 2010, data were accumulated from 77 liver transplant centers. The Registry contains 1940 patients, and 1379 are alive. Eighty-eight Ltx were performed in combination with a heart and/or kidney transplantation. Overall, 20-year survival after Ltx was 55.3%. Multivariate analysis revealed modified body mass index, early onset of disease (<50 years of age), disease duration before Ltx, and TTR Val30Met versus non-TTR Val30Met mutations as independent significant survival factors. Early-onset patients had an expected mortality rate of 38% that of the late-onset group (P<0.001). Furthermore, Val30Met patients had an expected mortality rate of 61% that of non-TTR Val30Met patients (P<0.001). With each year of duration of disease before Ltx, expected mortality increased by 11% (P<0.001). With each 100-unit increase in modified body mass index at Ltx, the expected mortality decreased to 89% of the expected mortality (P<0.001).

During postoperative checks by an anesthesiologist, it was noticed that patients who reported sore throat often required GlideScope laryngoscopy. Consequently, it is difficult to determine whether postoperative sore throats are caused by irritation inflicted by multiple laryngoscopic attempts or the actual utilization of the GlideScope itself. The goal of this study was to determine whether the use of the GlideScope leads to a greater or lesser incidence of sore throat when compared with traditional laryngoscope blades used for intubation. Eligible patients scheduled for elective inpatient surgeries requiring endotracheal tube intubation were enrolled into this single-blinded prospective cohort study. \u03c7(2) Test, Fisher exact test, and t tests were used to compare differences across the primary end point and other demographic categories. Operating rooms and postanesthesia recovery unit, Albany Medical Center, Albany, NY. There were a total of 151 patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists grades 1 to 3 included in the study. Eighty-one patients were randomized to a control group that received traditional laryngoscopy via Macintosh/Miller blades and 70 patients received video-guided intubation via the GlideScope. The incidence of postoperative sore throat was recorded via a yes/no questionnaire within 24 hours after extubation. Secondary parameters such as provider type, sex, and perceived difficulty were also recorded. There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients reporting sore throat by type of blade used (Mac/Miller 36.3% vs GlideScope 32.4%, P = .619). For secondary outcomes, women were significantly more likely to report sore throat as compared with men (men 24.3% vs women 43.2%, P = .015), and the provider type was significantly associated with the occurrence of postoperative sore throat (attendings 26.8% vs certified registered nurse anesthetists 52.3% vs third-year clinical anesthesia residents 30%, P = .012).\nQuestion: Does the incidence of sore throat postoperatively increase with the use of a traditional intubation blade or the GlideScope?", "gt": "Use of the GlideScope videolaryngoscopy was not significantly associated with increased occurrence of postoperative sore throat when compared with traditional intubation techniques.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: The primary aim is to explore whether prescription drug expenditures by enrollees changed in Alabama's CHIP program, ALL Kids, after copayment increases in fiscal year 2004. The subsidiary aim is to explore whether non-pharmaceutical expenditures also changed. Data on ALL Kids enrollees between 1999-2007, obtained from claims files and the state's administrative database. We used data on children who were enrolled between one and three years both before and after the changes to the copayment schedule, and estimate regression models with individual-level fixed effects to control for time-invariant heterogeneity at the child level. This allows an accurate estimate of how program expenditures change for the same individual following copayment changes. Primary outcomes of interest are expenditures for prescription drugs by class and brand-name and generic versions. We estimate models for the likelihood of any use of prescription drugs and expenditure level conditional on use. Following the copayment increase, the probability of any expenditure decline by 5.8%, brand name drugs by 6.9%, generic drugs by 7.4%. Conditional on any use, program expenditures decline by 7.9% for all drugs, by 9.6% for brand name drugs, and 6.2% for generic drugs. The largest declines are for antihistamine drugs; the least declines are for Central Nervous System agents. Declines are smaller and statistically weaker for children with chronic health conditions. Concurrent declines are also seen for non-pharmaceutical medical expenditures.\nQuestion: Can increases in CHIP copayments reduce program expenditures on prescription drugs?", "gt": "Copayment increases appear to reduce program expenditures on prescription drugs per enrollee and may be a useful tool for controlling program costs.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Yes, increases in CHIP copayments can reduce program expenditures on prescription drugs.

To compare the prevalence and severity of OSA in patients submitted to horizontal and vertical partial laryngectomy and assess the role of spirometry for these patients. Cross-sectional clinical study with individuals offered partial laryngectomy. The included patients were assessed through interview, upper airway endoscopy, polysomnography, and spirometry. Fourteen patients were evaluated and 92.3% were found to have OSA. The apnea-hypopnea index was significantly higher among patients submitted to vertical laryngectomy (mean = 36.9) when compared to subjects offered horizontal laryngectomy (mean = 11.2).

Patients with significant tumour downsizing (>30% of the initial tumour size) were compared with controls (<30% reduction of the initial tumour size). During flexible proctoscopy carried out postchemoradiation, biopsies were performed using 3-mm biopsy forceps. The biopsy results were compared with the histopathological findings of the resected specimen. UICC (Union for International Cancer Control) ypTNM classification, tumour differentiation and regression grade were evaluated. The main outcome measures were sensitivity and specificity, negative and positive predictive values, and accuracy of a simple forceps biopsy for predicting pathological response after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Of the 172 patients, 112 were considered to have had an incomplete clinical response and were included in the study. Thirty-nine patients achieved significant tumour downsizing and underwent postchemoradiation biopsies. Overall, 53 biopsies were carried out. Of the 39 patients who achieved significant tumour downsizing, the biopsy result was positive in 25 and negative in 14.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: We assessed whether testicular growth arrest is related to varicocele size in adolescents. We also determined whether adolescents with a varicocele and testes of equal size treated nonoperatively are at significant risk for growth arrest and, if so, whether this risk is related to varicocele size. We retrospectively reviewed the records of boys with a varicocele. Testis volume was measured with calipers and computed into cc as (length x width x breadth) x 0.521. Testicular growth arrest was defined as left testis at least 15% smaller than the right testis. Varicocele size was graded 1-barely palpable, 2-palpable but not visible, 3a-visible and, 1 to 1.5 times the size of the ipsilateral testis, 3b-1.5 to 2 times the size of the ipsilateral testis and 3c-greater than 2 times the size of the ipsilateral testis. Boys with a grade 1 varicocele and those treated with previous inguinal or testicular surgery were excluded from study. Repair was recommended for testicular growth arrest or discomfort. Data were analyzed with chi-square and Fisher's exact test. The records of 124 boys 7 to 18 years old (mean age 13) with a varicocele were reviewed. Seven patients were excluded from analysis, yielding a total of 117 boys. Testicular growth arrest was observed at initial visit in 10 of 33 (30.3%) grade 2, 18 of 37 (48.6%) grade 3a, 14 of 31 (45.2%) grade 3b and 6 of 16 (37.5%) grade 3c cases (p not significant), or a total of 38 of 84 (45.2%) grade 3 cases (p<0.01) plus grade 2.

However, the study noted that the differences in growth arrest rates across different grades of varicocele size were not statistically significant (p not significant).\n\nOverall, the study found that testicular growth arrest was more common in boys with grade 3 varicoceles compared to grade 2 varicoceles (56% vs. 39%, p<0.01). This suggests that varicocele size does make a difference in the risk of testicular growth arrest, with larger varicoceles being associated with a higher risk of growth arrest. However, the differences in growth arrest rates between different grades of varicocele size were not statistically significant for boys with initially equal-sized testes, indicating that while there is a trend towards increased risk with larger varicoceles, the relationship is not strong enough to conclude a significant difference in growth arrest rates based solely on varicocele size."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Anterior shoulder instability with bone loss can be treated successfully with the modified Bristow procedure. Opinions vary regarding the role of the soft-tissue sling created by the conjoined tendon after transfer. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the effect of the modified Bristow procedure and conjoined tendon transfer on glenohumeral translation and kinematics after creating anterior instability. Eight cadaveric shoulders were tested with a custom shoulder testing system. Range-of-motion, translation, and kinematic testing was performed in 60\u00b0 of glenohumeral abduction in the scapular and coronal planes under the following conditions: intact joint, Bankart lesion with 20% glenoid bone loss, modified Bristow procedure, and soft tissue-only conjoined tendon transfer. A Bankart lesion with 20% bone loss resulted in significantly increased external rotation and translation compared with the intact condition (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05), as well as an anterior shift of the humeral head apex at all points of external rotation. Both the modified Bristow procedure and soft-tissue Bristow procedure maintained the increase in external rotation but resulted in significantly decreased translation (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05). There was no difference in translation between the 2 reconstructions.\nQuestion: Biomechanical analysis of the modified Bristow procedure for anterior shoulder instability: is the bone block necessary?", "gt": "The increase in external rotation suggests that the modified Bristow procedure does not initially restrict joint motion.

The study indicates that the presence of a Bankart lesion with 20% bone loss leads to increased external rotation and translation, as well as an anterior shift of the humeral head apex.\n\nWhen comparing the modified Bristow procedure (which includes both the bone block and the conjoined tendon transfer) with the soft-tissue-only conjoined tendon transfer, there was no significant difference in translation reduction between the two methods. This implies that the bone block may not be necessary for the reduction of translation alone, as the soft-tissue component appears to be sufficient for this purpose.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while the biomechanical outcomes in terms of translation were similar between the two procedures, the clinical implications of including a bone block might still be relevant for other aspects of shoulder stability or long-term outcomes that were not addressed in this specific study. Clinical outcomes, patient-specific factors, and the surgeon's experience could also influence the decision to include a bone block in the procedure.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the biomechanical analysis provided, the bone block may not be strictly necessary for reducing translation in anterior shoulder instability with bone loss. However, the decision to include it should be considered in the broader context of clinical practice and patient needs."}

The objective for this case series discussion was to identify any differences in cerebral tissue oxygenation secondary to induction of anesthesia with sevoflurane versus propofol. METHODS/ After institutional review board approval, the computer data of tissue cerebral oximetry of pediatric patients (1-18 years age group) undergoing non-cardiac surgeries was comparatively analyzed for changes over time between the groups of children who received sevoflurane induction versus propofol induction of anesthesia. \"Hyperoxia\" (\"hyperoxygenation\") was defined as significant percent changes from the baseline values as recorded in tissue cerebral oximetry. In this case series, seven patients underwent inhalational (INH) induction with high concentrations (8%) sevoflurane with nitrous oxide in 33% oxygen and four patients underwent intravenous (i.v.) induction with 2 mg/kg propofol and nitrous oxide in 33% oxygen.

A quantitative study based on a self-completion survey questionnaire completed in 2010. Nurses employed in two UK National Health Service Foundation Trusts were surveyed and assessed using seven work-related constructs and various demographics including age generation. Through correlation, multiple regression and stepwise regression analysis, the potential combined effect of various explanatory variables on continuation intention was assessed, across the entire nursing cohort and in three age-generation groups. Three variables act in combination to explain continuation intention: work-family conflict, work attachment and importance of work to the individual.

Manual technique imprecision urges the need for a rapid reliable automated test. We evaluated the H800-FUSIOO automatic urine sediment analyzer and compared it to the manual urinalysis technique to determine if it may be a competitive substitute in laboratories of central hospitals. 1000 urine samples were examined by the two methods in parallel. Agreement, precision, carryover, drift, sensitivity, specificity, and practicability criteria were tested. Agreement ranged from excellent to good for all urine semi-quantitative components (K>0.4, p = 0.000), except for granular casts (K = 0.317, p = 0.000). Specific gravity results correlated well between the two methods (r = 0.884, p = 0.000). RBCS and WBCs showed moderate correlation (r = 0.42, p = 0.000) and (r = 0.44, p = 0.000), respectively.

However, the between-run precision for the negative control was poor.\n- **Carryover and Drift**: These aspects were satisfactory.\n- **Manual Technique Limitations**: Inter-observer discrepancy was significant, while intra-observer correlation was strong.\n\nThese results suggest that while the automated method offers several advantages, such as improved consistency and precision, it may require operator intervention at critical cutoff values, particularly for components like granular casts and proteins. The manual technique, despite its imprecision, still holds some relevance due to its reliability in intra-observer readings.\n\nIn summary, the transition to automated urinalysis techniques appears promising, especially in central hospitals where precision and reliability are paramount. However, the need for human oversight in certain aspects and further refinement of the automated system could enhance its effectiveness and reliability, making it a competitive substitute for manual techniques."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Despite the implementation of a Quebec immunization program against influenza and pneumococcal disease (PQIIP), vaccine coverage has remained low. There have been many studies on personal barriers to vaccination, but few have explored other kinds of barriers. To explore the presence of barriers in relation to the organization of the health care system and to propose recommendations for increasing vaccine coverage. Within a mixed protocol, a phone survey of 996 people in the target population and a case study implicating the follow-up of the PQIIP with all the site and actor categories via 43 semistructured interviews and 4 focus groups were realized. Survey data underwent a descriptive statistical analysis. Qualitative analysis followed the Miles and Huberman approach. The results indicate the presence of barriers with regard to information accessibility. These include access to: the physicians' recommendation, knowledge of the efficacy or the security of vaccines, and admissibility of clients to the PQIIP. Organizational barriers were also found to limit access to vaccination, especially in terms of restricted choices of time and location. Coordination and incentives mechanisms are not optimal. Removal of organizational barriers depends more on strategic rather than structural factors.\nQuestion: Do organizational barriers to pneumococcal and influenza vaccine access exist?", "gt": "Addressing organizational barriers should be an important component of strategies aimed at improving vaccine coverage.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: The independent effect of lipid lowering therapy (LLT) on venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk is uncertain. To test statin and non-statin LLT as potential VTE risk factors. Using Rochester Epidemiology Project resources, we identified all Olmsted County, MN residents with objectively diagnosed incident VTE (cases) over the 13-year period, 1988-2000 (n=1340), and one to two matched controls (n=1538). We reviewed their complete medical records for baseline characteristics previously identified as independent VTE risk factors, and for statin and non-statin LLT. Using conditional logistic regression, we tested the overall effect of LLT on VTE risk and also separately explored the role of statin versus that of non-statin LLT, adjusting for other baseline characteristics. Among cases and controls, 74 and 111 received statin LLT, and 32 and 50 received non-statin LLT, respectively. Univariately, and after individually controlling for other potential VTE risk factors (i.e., BMI, trauma/fracture, leg paresis, hospitalization for surgery or medical illness, nursing home residence, active cancer, central venous catheter, varicose veins, prior superficial vein thrombosis, diabetes, congestive heart failure, angina/myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, smoking, anticoagulation), LLT was associated with decreased odds of VTE (unadjusted OR=0.73; p=0.03). When considered separately, statin and non-statin LLT were each associated with moderate, non-significant lower odds of VTE. After adjusting for angina/myocardial infarction, each was significantly associated with decreased odds of VTE (OR=0.63, p<0.01 and OR=0.61, p=0.04, respectively).\nQuestion: Is lipid lowering therapy an independent risk factor for venous thromboembolism?", "gt": "LLT is associated with decreased VTE risk after adjusting for known risk factors.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the provided context, lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) is not an independent risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE); rather, it is associated with a decreased odds of VTE.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: The objective of this study was to quantify the effects of radiation-induced cancer risks in patients with Bosniak category IIF lesions undergoing CT versus MRI surveillance. We developed a Markov-Monte Carlo model to determine life expectancy losses attributable to radiation-induced cancers in hypothetical patients undergoing CT versus MRI surveillance of Bosniak IIF lesions. Our model tracked hypothetical patients as they underwent imaging surveillance for up to 5 years, accounting for potential lesion progression and treatment. Estimates of radiation-induced cancer mortality were generated using a published organ-specific radiation-risk model based on Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation VII methods. The model also incorporated surgical mortality and renal cancer-specific mortality. Our primary outcome was life expectancy loss attributable to radiation-induced cancers. A sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the stability of the results with variability in key parameters. The mean number of examinations per patient was 6.3. In the base case, assuming 13 mSv per multiphase CT examination, 64-year-old men experienced an average life expectancy decrease of 5.5 days attributable to radiation-induced cancers from CT; 64-year-old women experienced a corresponding life expectancy loss of 6.9 days. The results were most sensitive to patient age: Life expectancy loss attributable to radiation-induced cancers increased to 21.6 days in 20-year-old women and 20.0 days in 20-year-old men. Varied assumptions of each modality's (CT vs MRI) depiction of lesion complexity also impacted life expectancy losses.\nQuestion: Microsimulation model of CT versus MRI surveillance of Bosniak IIF renal cystic lesions: should effects of radiation exposure affect selection of imaging strategy?", "gt": "Microsimulation modeling shows that radiation-induced cancer risks from CT surveillance for Bosniak IIF lesions minimally affect life expectancy. However, as progressively younger patients are considered, increasing radiation risks merit stronger consideration of MRI surveillance.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "The study you've described uses a sophisticated microsimulation model to compare the effects of radiation-induced cancer risks between CT and MRI surveillance strategies for patients with Bosniak category IIF renal cystic lesions. The model, which is a Markov-Monte Carlo simulation, evaluates life expectancy losses due to radiation-induced cancers over a surveillance period of up to 5 years. This approach helps in understanding the long-term impacts of repeated radiation exposure from CT scans, which are more frequent in the surveillance of these lesions compared to MRI.\n\nThe key findings indicate that while the average life expectancy loss due to radiation-induced cancers is relatively small (5.5 days for men and 6.9 days for women at age 64), it is significantly more pronounced in younger patients, with life expectancy losses of up to 21.6 days for women and 20.0 days for men at age 20. This suggests that the effects of radiation exposure should indeed be considered when selecting an imaging strategy, particularly for younger patients who are likely to have a longer life ahead and thus a higher chance of developing radiation-induced cancers over time.\n\nMoreover, the study highlights that the choice between CT and MRI should not be made solely based on radiation exposure but should also consider factors such as the ability of each imaging modality to accurately depict lesion complexity. This is because accurate lesion characterization can influence the timing and type of surgical intervention, which in turn can impact patient outcomes and life expectancy.\n\nIn conclusion, while the absolute life expectancy losses due to radiation-induced cancers are modest, they should be considered as part of a broader assessment that includes the patient's age, the potential for lesion progression, and the diagnostic accuracy of each imaging modality. This comprehensive approach will help in making a more informed decision about the imaging strategy that best balances the risks and benefits for each individual patient."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: The differentiation between cardiac and esophageal causes of retrosternal chest pain is notoriously difficult. Theoretically, cardiac and esophageal causes may coexist. It has also been reported that gastroesophageal reflux and esophageal motor abnormalities may elicit myocardial ischemia and chest pain, a phenomenon called linked angina pectoris. The aim of this study was to assess the incidence of esophageal abnormalities as a cause of retrosternal chest pain in patients with previously documented coronary artery disease. Thirty consecutive patients were studied, all of whom had undergone coronary arteriography. The patients were studied after they were admitted to the coronary care unit with an attack of typical chest pain. On electrocardiograms (ECGs) taken during pain, 15 patients (group I) had new signs of ischemia; the other 15 patients (group II) did not. In none of the patients were cardiac enzymes elevated. As soon as possible, but within 2 hours after admission, combined 24-hour recording of esophageal pressure and pH was performed. During chest pain, 12-lead ECG recording was carried out. In group I, all 15 patients experienced one or more pain episodes during admission, 25 of which were associated with ischemic electrocardiographic changes. The other two episodes were reflux-related. Only one of the 25 ischemia-associated pain episodes was also reflux-related, ie, it was preceded by a reflux episode. In group II, 19 chest pain episodes occurred in 11 patients. None of these was associated with electrocardiographic changes, but 8 were associated with reflux (42%) and 8 with abnormal esophageal motility (42%).\nQuestion: Esophageal dysfunction as a cause of angina pectoris (\"linked angina\"): does it exist?", "gt": "Linked angina is a rare phenomenon.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Yes, esophageal dysfunction can indeed be a cause of angina pectoris, a phenomenon known as \"linked angina.\" The context provided discusses a study where esophageal abnormalities, such as gastroesophageal reflux and esophageal motor abnormalities, were found to elicit myocardial ischemia and chest pain in some patients.

During 1982-2004, 13 015 people aged<or = 29 years were diagnosed with primary leukaemia or lymphoma in Australia. For those with ALL, 5-year survival for adolescents improved from 40% (1982-1989) to 74% (2000-2004); the improvement for young adults was smaller (31% to 47%), and both these groups still had lower survival than children, whose 5-year survival improved from 74% to 88%. There was a larger narrowing of the gap for AML: for cases diagnosed in 2000-2004, 5-year survival was similar for young adults (63%), adolescents (74%) and children (69%).

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: We propose a simple and inexpensive in vitro crystallization assay of measuring turbidity by spectrophotometry in synthetic urine. We validated our method by investigating the effect of potassium (K) citrate on the crystallization of calcium oxalate monohydrate (CaOx), calcium phosphate, and magnesium ammonium phosphate using synthetic urine. The crystallization of CaOx was studied using turbidimetric measurements of solution produced by mixing calcium chloride and sodium oxalate at 37 \u00b0C, pH 5.7. The turbidity of the crystal suspension was measured immediately with double-beam spectrophotometer as the absorbance of light at 660 nm wavelength. The rates of crystal formation and aggregation were obtained by measuring optical density (OD) over 30 min. The obtained results were compared to CaOx crystal concentration with and without citrate assessed by optical microscopy. The sensitivity of spectrophotometry in measuring turbidity was confirmed by the linear correlation between the crystal concentration and OD readings at 660 nm seen on the standard curve. Under similar experimental conditions, the results were comparable to the ones obtained by optical microscopy. The OD readings over 30 min revealed an instant decrease in the number of crystals, with maximum aggregation noted at 18 min. Addition of K-citrate at 1.25 mg/ml led to initial less crystal formation (OD = 0.236 nm vs. OD = 0.527 nm), with a maximum aggregation reached at 18 min. Overall, citrate addition decreased nucleation with a small change in the aggregation (OD = 0.316 vs. OD = 0.359).\nQuestion: Urinary turbidity as a marker of crystallization: is spectrophotometric assessment useful?", "gt": "Spectrophotometric measurement of urinary turbidity is feasible and sensitive in assessing the potential clinical usefulness of different medications in inhibiting crystallization in urine.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the context provided, spectrophotometric assessment is indeed useful as a marker of crystallization in synthetic urine. The method described uses turbidity measurements at 660 nm wavelength to assess the crystallization of various compounds, including calcium oxalate monohydrate (CaOx). The study's validation through a comparison with optical microscopy results shows that spectrophotometry can accurately reflect changes in crystal concentration over time. Specifically, the linear correlation between crystal concentration and optical density (OD) readings at 660 nm supports the sensitivity and reliability of spectrophotometry in this context. Additionally, the method demonstrated its capability to detect both the initial formation and the aggregation of crystals, with the addition of potassium citrate notably affecting these processes. Therefore, spectrophotometric assessment appears to be a simple, inexpensive, and effective tool for monitoring crystallization in synthetic urine, making it a useful marker for such studies."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Whether and when to transfuse in anemia of prematurity is highly controversial. Some authors suggest transfusions simply if the hemoglobin (Hb) level is below a defined normal range. Others propose the use of clinical or laboratory parameters in anemic patients to decide whether to transfuse or not. A decreasing amount of circulating Hb should cause a compensatory increase in cardiac output (CO) and an increase in arterial serum lactate. In 56 anemic preterm infants (not in respiratory or hemodynamic failure) we analyzed CO after the first week of life using a Doppler sonographic method. At the same time serum lactate levels, Hb levels and oxygen saturation were registered. Nineteen of these patients were given transfusion when they demonstrated clinical signs of anemia by tachycardia>180/min, tachypnea, retractions, apneas and centralization (group 2). The remaining 37 patients were not transfused (group 1). Serum lactate, CO, heart rate (HR), oxygen delivery, respiratory rate, capillary refill and Hb were analyzed in both groups and in group 2 before and 12-24 h after transfusion. Data between groups 1 and 2 and in group 2 before and after transfusion were compared. In the 56 patients studied no linear correlation between Hb and CO or between Hb and serum lactate was found. Nor could any correlation be demonstrated between the other variables studied. Examining the subgroups separately, a negative linear correlation was demonstrated between serum lactate and oxygen delivery in group 2. No other significant correlations were detected. However, when the pre- and post-transfusion data were compared in group 2 (increase of Hb from 9.45 (SD 3.44) to 12.5 (SD 3.8) g/100 ml), the CO decreased from 281.3 (SD 162.6) to 224 (SD 95.7) ml/kg per min (p<0.01) and serum lactate decreased significantly from 3.23 mmol/l (SD 2.07) before to 1.71 (SD 0.83) after transfusion. Oxygen delivery was 35.8 (+/- 0.19) ml/kg per min group 1, 27.8 (+/- 0.05) pre- and 43.4 (+/- 0.07) post-transfusion in group 2 (p<0.01).\nQuestion: Do cardiac output and serum lactate levels indicate blood transfusion requirements in anemia of prematurity?", "gt": "CO measurements and serum lactate levels add little information to the decision-making process for blood transfusions, as neither CO nor serum lactate levels correlate with HB levels in an otherwise asymptomatic population of preterm infants. In infants where the indication for blood transfusion is made based on traditionally accepted clinical criteria, serum lactate is an additional laboratory indicator of impaired oxygenation, as it correlates significantly with oxygen delivery. A significant lower oxygen delivery in patients in whom blood transfusion is indicated and an increase in oxygen induced by transfusion demonstrate the value of these criteria in identifying preterm infants who benefit from transfusion.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the provided context, cardiac output (CO) and serum lactate levels do not linearly correlate with hemoglobin (Hb) levels in anemic preterm infants, suggesting that these parameters alone may not be reliable indicators for determining the need for blood transfusions in anemia of prematurity.

However, after transfusion in the subgroup of 19 patients (Group 2) who showed clinical signs of anemia, there was a significant decrease in both CO and serum lactate levels, indicating some improvement in oxygen delivery post-transfusion. This suggests that while CO and serum lactate levels may not be direct indicators for transfusion needs, they can reflect the physiological response to transfusion. Therefore, the decision to transfuse should not be based solely on CO and serum lactate levels but should consider clinical signs and other parameters as well."}

The performance of these algorithms was compared to that of passive learning on the five datasets. We then conducted a novel investigation of the interaction between dataset characteristics and the performance results. Classification accuracy and area under receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves for each algorithm at different sample sizes were generated.

Specifically, the DIST algorithm outperformed passive learning in all five datasets with statistical significance at the 0.05 level. The CMB algorithm was also found to be better than passive learning in four out of the five datasets. This indicates that active learning strategies can be more effective than random sampling (passive learning) for clinical text classification tasks."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: To compare regional body fat distribution and sex hormone status of postmenopausal women with NIDDM with those of age- and BMI-matched normoglycemic women. The regional body fat distribution and sex hormone status of 42 postmenopausal women with NIDDM were compared with those of 42 normoglycemic women matched for age and BMI, who served as control subjects. Body composition was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and testosterone were measured in serum. Although the levels of total body fat were similar between the two groups, the women with NIDDM had significantly less lower-body fat (LBF) (P<0.01) than the control subjects matched for age and BMI. This pattern of fat deposition in women with NIDDM was accompanied by an androgenic hormone profile, with decreased SHBG concentration and an increased free androgen index (P<0.05 and P<0.01, respectively).\nQuestion: Do postmenopausal women with NIDDM have a reduced capacity to deposit and conserve lower-body fat?", "gt": "A reduced capacity to deposit and/or conserve LBF may be an independent factor associated with (or may be a marker of) the metabolic manifestations of the insulin resistance syndrome in women with NIDDM.

Additionally, the pattern of fat distribution in these women was associated with an androgenic hormone profile, characterized by decreased levels of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and an increased free androgen index, which further suggests a hormonal influence on their fat distribution."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: To compare efficacy and safety of 5% lidocaine medicated plaster with pregabalin in patients with post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), and to assess the benefits of combining both drugs in patients not responding to either single agent.

Patients with an absolute value of>4 on the NRS-3 were randomly assigned to 4-week treatment with 5% lidocaine medicated plaster or twice-daily pregabalin capsules titrated to effect. Subsequently, patients sufficiently treated with monotherapy (patients with NRS-3<or=4 at 4 weeks or a reduction on the NRS-3 from baseline of>or=2 points) continued with monotherapy; patients insufficiently treated with monotherapy received both drugs in combination for 8 weeks. Pain according to SF-MPQ and NPSI, onset of effect, reduction in worst pain on the NRS; allodynia severity; quality of life (QoL) based on EQ-5D, SF-36; PGIC; rescue medication intake; adverse events (AEs) monitoring. At 4 weeks, SF-MPQ total scores improved by -7.6 +/- 6.66 (mean +/- SD) under 5% lidocaine medicated plaster and by -5.3 +/- 7.93 under pregabalin. NPSI total scores declined by -1.6 +/- 1.73 under 5% lidocaine medicated plaster and -1.4 +/- 1.87 under pregabalin. Lidocaine plaster was also effective in reducing worst pain and showed a fast onset of effect. During combination treatment, SF-MPQ and NPSI scores, allodynia, EQ-5D and PGIC improved.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Clinically valid cardiac evaluation via treadmill stress testing requires patients to achieve specific target heart rates and to successfully complete the cardiac examination. A comparison of the standard Bruce protocol and the ramped Bruce protocol was performed using data collected over a 1-y period from a targeted patient population with a body mass index (BMI) equal to or greater than 30 to determine which treadmill protocol provided more successful examination results. The functional capacity, metabolic equivalent units achieved, pressure rate product, and total time on the treadmill as measured for the obese patients were clinically valid and comparable to normal-weight and overweight patients (P<0.001). Data gathered from each protocol demonstrated that the usage of the ramped Bruce protocol achieved more consistent results in comparison across all BMI groups in achieving 80%-85% of their age-predicted maximum heart rate.\nQuestion: Comparison of Bruce treadmill exercise test protocols: is ramped Bruce equal or superior to standard bruce in producing clinically valid studies for patients presenting for evaluation of cardiac ischemia or arrhythmia with body mass index equal to or greater than 30?", "gt": "This study did not adequately establish that the ramped Bruce protocol was superior to the standard Bruce protocol for the examination of patients with a BMI equal to or greater than 30.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the provided context, the ramped Bruce protocol appears to be superior to the standard Bruce protocol in producing clinically valid studies for patients with a body mass index (BMI) equal to or greater than 30.

The following parameters were registered in each patient: age, sex, number of episodes, season, month, week, day, hour and lunar phase. Epistaxis represented 12.1% of the total otolaryngological emergencies. That means an incidence of 0.1% of non traumatic epistaxis which needed hospital specialized attention.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: We assessed the outcome of vesicoureteral reflux after augmentation cystoplasty in patients with neurogenic bladder. Since May 1992, 112 male and 18 female patients with neurogenic bladder have undergone augmentation cystoplasty with a generous detubularized segment of bowel and no effort to correct existing reflux. Patients were treated conservatively at the beginning but the response was unsatisfactory. All patients had various degrees of vesicoureteral reflux (197 refluxing units). Mean age at operation was 21.6 years (range 1.5 to 57). Preoperatively assessment included urinalysis, urine culture, kidney function tests, voiding cystourethrography, urodynamic evaluation, ultrasonography or excretory urography and cystoscopy when indicated. The status of vesicoureteral reflux, renal hydronephrosis and clinical pyelonephritis were studied during an average followup of 44.5 months. Of the 130 patients 111 (85.4%) no longer had reflux, 14 (10.8%) had improvement, 4 (3%) had no change and 1 (0.8%) had worsening reflux. All refluxing units with grades I to III, 105 of 120 with grade IV (87.5%) and 8 of 13 with grade V (61.5%) showed complete cessation of reflux. Renal hydronephrosis improved in 127 renal units (97.7%).

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Immunoglobulin A (IgA) anti-endomysium antibodies, the most reliable immunological marker for both the screening and follow-up of coeliac disease, need monkey oesophagus as antigenic substrate; this limits their use because of high costs and the exploitation of endangered species. (1) To compare the diagnostic accuracy of anti-endomysium antibodies detected by indirect immunofluorescence on monkey oesophagus and on human umbilical cord; (2) to evaluate their reliability during follow-up in detecting non-compliant patients. One hundred and four untreated adults with biopsy-proven coeliac disease and 94 controls were investigated. Endomysium antibodies were found in 99 patients (95%) on both substrates, with a specificity, respectively, of 100% and 99% on monkey oesophagus and umbilical cord. One year after gluten withdrawal, out of 47 patients who were investigated, only six presented with complete mucosal recovery: none of these subjects was positive on either substrates, while, among patients with persistent histological alterations, endomysium positivity persisted in only 10 on monkey oesophagus, but in 32 on umbilical cord. Histology (recovery or persistent involvement) was in agreement with endomysium (negative or positive) in 34% on monkey oesophagus, but in 81% on umbilical cord (P<0.0001).\nQuestion: Is human umbilical cord the most suitable substrate for the detection of endomysium antibodies in the screening and follow-up of coeliac disease?", "gt": "Human umbilical cord, with its comparable diagnostic efficiency, could replace monkey tissues, with the advantages of saving both money and monkeys.

This conclusion is supported by several key points from the study:\n\n1. **Diagnostic Accuracy**: The specificity of detecting endomysium antibodies was very high for both substrates, with 100% on monkey oesophagus and 99% on human umbilical cord. This indicates that both substrates are highly reliable in identifying patients with coeliac disease.\n\n2. **Follow-up Reliability**: After one year of gluten withdrawal, the study found that the detection of endomysium antibodies on human umbilical cord was more reliably correlated with histological recovery than the detection on monkey oesophagus. Specifically, the agreement between histology (indicating recovery or persistent involvement) and endomysium antibody status was significantly higher on umbilical cord (81%) compared to monkey oesophagus (34%).\n\n3. **Detection of Non-Compliant Patients**: The study also showed that the persistence of endomysium antibodies was more accurately detected on human umbilical cord in patients who did not achieve complete mucosal recovery, suggesting that this substrate might be better at identifying patients who are not adhering to a gluten-free diet.\n\nConsidering these factors, the human umbilical cord seems to be more suitable for detecting endomysium antibodies, particularly in follow-up scenarios, due to its higher agreement with histological outcomes and potential for identifying non-compliant patients. Additionally, using human umbilical cord avoids the ethical concerns and high costs associated with using monkey oesophagus."}

Qualitative study based on 35 in-depth interviews with a purposive sample of frontline health professionals involved in health policy and service provision in the Northern Territory. Participants described three factors that contributed to the under-resourcing of Aboriginal health: inefficient funding arrangements, mainstream programs being inappropriate for Aboriginal Australians, and competing interests determining the allocation of resources. Insufficient capacity within the healthcare system undermines the multilevel implementation process whereby organisations need to have the capacity to recognise new policy ideas, assess their relevance to their existing work and strategic plan and to be able to incorporate the relevant new ideas into day-to-day practice.\nQuestion: Efficient funding: a path to improving Aboriginal healthcare in Australia?", "gt": "Insufficient resources for Aboriginal health were found to be a barrier to implementing Aboriginal health policy.

The qualitative study highlights inefficient funding as one of the key factors contributing to the under-resourcing of Aboriginal health services. By improving the efficiency of funding, resources could be allocated more effectively, potentially leading to better healthcare outcomes for Aboriginal Australians.\n\nAdditionally, the study points out that mainstream health programs often do not cater well to the specific needs of Aboriginal Australians, suggesting that funding should not only be increased but also directed towards culturally appropriate services. This targeted funding can help in developing programs that are more relevant and effective for Aboriginal communities.\n\nMoreover, there is a need to address competing interests in resource allocation. Ensuring that funding is transparent and directed towards health policies and services that are prioritized by the Aboriginal communities themselves could help in aligning resources with community needs and expectations.\n\nImproving the capacity of the healthcare system is also crucial. With more efficient funding, healthcare organizations could have the necessary resources to implement new policies, assess their relevance, and integrate them into daily practices. This would help in overcoming the current capacity issues that hinder the effective implementation of health policies designed to improve Aboriginal health.\n\nIn summary, while efficient funding alone is not a complete solution, it is a critical component in addressing the under-resourcing of Aboriginal health and could significantly contribute to improving healthcare outcomes for Aboriginal Australians."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Pleiotropic effects of recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO) have recently been discovered in many non-renal animal models. The renoprotective effects of EPO and carbamylated-erythropoietin (CEPO), a novel EPO which has a small stimulatory effect on hemoglobin, have never been explored in unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO), a chronic tubulointerstitial (TI) disease model which is independent of systemic factors. In order to examine the effects of EPO and CEPO treatments on renal TI injury, 36 male Sprague-Dawley rats, weighing 250-320 g, underwent: UUO without treatment (group 1, n = 12), UUO with EPO (groups 2, n = 12), and UUO with CEPO (group 3, n = 12). EPO and CEPO were injected subcutaneously at a dose of 5000 u/kg to each respective rat at 1 day pre-UUO and at day 3, 7 and 10 post-UUO. After days 3, 7, and 14 of UUO, TI injury, collagen, alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) positive cell, ED1-positive cell, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) mediated nick-end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cell, and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) were determined. Bcl-2 expression was also assessed to verify the mechanism of apoptosis. At day 14 UUO caused severe TI injury with a significant increase in collagen, alpha-SMA, ED1-positive cell, TUNEL-positive cell, and TGF-beta1 mRNA expression. Administration of EPO and CEPO significantly attenuated TI injury, collagen, ED1-positive cells, and TUNEL-positive cells. Only CEPO-treated rats had decreased alpha-SMA positive cells and TGF-beta1 mRNA. The expression of Bcl-2 was demonstrated only in EPO-treated rats. The hematocrit levels in EPO-treated rats were higher than the control and CEPO-treated rats.\nQuestion: Erythropoietin and its non-erythropoietic derivative: do they ameliorate renal tubulointerstitial injury in ureteral obstruction?", "gt": "EPO and CEPO can limit 14-day UUO-induced TI injury by reducing inflammation, interstitial fibrosis, and tubular apoptosis.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Yes, both erythropoietin (EPO) and its non-erythropoietic derivative, carbamylated-erythropoietin (CEPO), have been shown to ameliorate renal tubulointerstitial (TI) injury in the context of ureteral obstruction (UUO).

Additionally, CEPO treatment specifically led to a reduction in alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) positive cells and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) mRNA, indicating a reduction in fibrotic processes. EPO treatment was associated with increased Bcl-2 expression, a protein known for its anti-apoptotic properties, suggesting a mechanism through which EPO may protect against TI injury.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: The sensitivity of endocervical curettage (ECC) can be suboptimal because of limited epithelial tissue. The false-negative rate for ECC in patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia involving the endocervical canal has been reported to be 45%. ECC samples are transported to pathology in formalin- or saline-filled containers; this fluid is discarded after the specimen has been submitted. We evaluated the utility of performing liquid-based cytological preparations from ECC transport container fluid as a way to increase the sensitivity of ECC specimens. Consecutive ECC specimens received at one of the two participating institutions were selected prospectively. A surgical pathology mesh bag was placed over a ThinPrep(\u00ae) CytoLyt(\u00ae) solution container, and the specimen was filtered through the bag, collecting the transport fluid in the container. The CytoLyt(\u00ae) was processed to obtain a container fluid ThinPrep(\u00ae) (CF-TP) liquid-based Papanicolaou (Pap) slide. The CF-TP slides were reviewed and the findings were compared with those from the ECC and follow-up specimens. The cohort included 53 patients. Discrepancies between CF-TP and ECC were seen in 14 of the 53 patients (26%); a more significant lesion was identified in CF-TP relative to ECC in 13 of these cases.

Traditionally, the fluid from ECC transport containers, which can contain cells from the endocervical canal, is discarded after the specimen is submitted for pathology. However, this study proposes that performing liquid-based cytological preparations, such as ThinPrep\u00ae Pap tests, on the transport fluid might capture additional diagnostic material that could otherwise be lost.\n\nIn the study, the researchers collected the transport fluid from ECC specimens and processed it to create ThinPrep\u00ae Pap slides (CF-TP slides). They then compared the findings from these slides with those from the ECC samples and any subsequent follow-up specimens. The results showed that there were discrepancies in 26% of the cases, with the CF-TP slides identifying a more significant lesion in 13 of these cases compared to the ECC samples. Furthermore, in eight out of 11 cases with histological follow-up, the CF-TP diagnosis was confirmed. Additionally, in six out of nine cases where the ECC was negative, the positive CF-TP result was confirmed by histology.\n\nThese findings suggest that the transport fluid from ECC samples, which is typically discarded, may indeed contain diagnostic material that could improve the sensitivity of ECC results. By performing ThinPrep\u00ae Pap tests on this fluid, there is a potential to capture more cells that might indicate the presence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, thereby reducing the false-negative rate associated with ECC. This approach could be particularly valuable in cases where the ECC sample itself might not have captured enough epithelial tissue to provide a definitive diagnosis. Thus, the question \"Is diagnostic material going down the drain?\" is answered affirmatively in the context of traditional ECC practices, and this study proposes a method to utilize that material effectively."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Upper GI (UGI) studies are routinely ordered to screen for malrotation before routine placement of gastrostomy (G) tubes. However, the usefulness of this study is unknown. A retrospective review of children with surgically placed G-tubes over a 2 year period (2011-2013) was performed. Patients with concomitant fundoplications were excluded. Three hundred ninety-three patients underwent G-tube placement. Of these, 299 patients (76%) had preoperative UGI, and 11 patients (3.7%) were identified with malrotation on UGI. Five (1.7%) patients underwent a Ladd's procedure. The remaining 6 either had malrotation associated with gastroschisis (n=5) or were lost to follow-up (n=1). Children<1 year did not have different rates of malrotation compared to older children (4.3% vs. 3.2%, p=0.617). Likewise, children with neurologic impairment (NI) had similar rates of malrotation compared to neurologically normal (NN) children (2.6% vs. 3.8%, p=0.692).

Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Prevalence of Malrotation**: Among 393 patients who underwent G-tube placement, only 11 (3.7%) were identified with malrotation on UGI. This indicates that malrotation is relatively uncommon in this patient population.\n\n2. **Operative Interventions**: Only 5 (1.7%) of the 393 patients required a Ladd's procedure, which is a surgical intervention to correct malrotation. This suggests that the majority of patients identified with malrotation on UGI did not require an immediate surgical intervention during the G-tube placement procedure.\n\n3. **Patient Groups**: The study did not find significant differences in malrotation rates between children <1 year old and older children, or between children with neurologic impairment and neurologically normal children. This implies that malrotation is not more common in these specific groups, and therefore, routine screening might not be justified based on these characteristics alone.\n\n4. **Significant Factor**: The only significant difference noted was in the presence of congenital gastrointestinal anomalies, where malrotation was more prevalent (24% vs. 1.5% in those without anomalies). This suggests that the presence of congenital gastrointestinal anomalies might be a more relevant indicator for the necessity of a preoperative UGI study.\n\nIn conclusion, while preoperative UGI studies can identify malrotation, the overall low incidence of malrotation and the rarity of requiring a Ladd's procedure during G-tube placement suggest that such routine screening may not significantly alter the operative plan for the majority of patients. However, the presence of congenital gastrointestinal anomalies might warrant more focused consideration for UGI studies."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Treatment of anemia is an important issue in the palliative care setting. Blood transfusion is generally used for this purpose in supportive care. However the place of blood transfusion in terminally ill cancer cases is less far established. We aimed to outline the use of transfusions and to find the impact of blood transfusion on survival in patients with advanced cancer and very near to death. Patients dying in 2010-2011 with advanced cancer were included in the study. We retrospectively collected the data including age, type of cancer, the duration of last hospitalisation, ECOG performance status, Hb levels, transfusion history of erythrocytes and platelets, cause and the amount of transfusion. The anaemic patients who had transfusion at admission were compared with the group who were not transfused. Survival was defined as the time between the admission of last hospitalisation period and death. Three hundred and ninety eight people with solid tumours died in 2010-2011 in our clinic. Ninety percent of the patients had anemia at the time of last hospitalisation. One hundred fifty three patients had erythrocyte transfusion at admission during the last hospitalisation period (38.4%). In the anaemic population the duration of last hospitalisation was longer in patients who had erythrocyte transfusion (15 days vs 8 days, p<0.001).\nQuestion: Use of blood transfusion at the end of life: does it have any effects on survival of cancer patients?", "gt": "Patients who had blood transfusion at the end of life lived significantly longer than the anaemic patients who were not transfused.

This was a retrospective chart review of all children who received CYC for SDNS and MCD between 1988 and 2009. Patients were divided into three groups based on kidney biopsy: MCD without immunoglobulin M (IgM) positivity (IgM-), MCD with IgM-positive immunofluorescence (IF) only (IgM+), and MCD with IgM-positive IF and electron-dense deposits on electron microscopy (IgM++). The relapse-free time interval to the first relapse post-CYC therapy or up to 48 months of follow-up (if no relapse occurred) was used for survival analysis. Forty children aged 1.5-12.3 years (15 were IgM-, 16 were IgM+, 9 were IgM++) received a cumulative CYC dose of 175 \u00b1 30 mg/kg. The overall relapse-free survival time was 75 % at 12 months, 64 % at 24 months, 59 % at 36 months, and 56 % at 48 months, with no significant differences between the IgM groups (p = 0.80).\nQuestion: Is cyclophosphamide effective in patients with IgM-positive minimal change disease?", "gt": "Based on our results, we conclude that more than 50% of our SDNS patients with MCD remained relapse-free 4 years post-CYC treatment.

The overall relapse-free survival rates were similar across all groups (IgM-, IgM+, and IgM++), with no significant differences observed between them (p = 0.80). This suggests that CYC treatment effectiveness is not significantly influenced by IgM positivity in patients with MCD. However, the relapse rates over time were notable, with 56% of patients remaining relapse-free at 48 months, indicating that while CYC is effective, relapses can still occur in a substantial portion of patients."}

The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of false positive SHIM diagnosis of ED in men with lifelong PE. SHIM, stopwatch intravaginal ejaculation latency time (IELT). A prospective observational study of men with normal erectile function and lifelong PE, diagnosed using the ISSM definition of lifelong PE, was conducted. The SHIM was self-administered at Visit 1. Mean per subject stopwatch IELT was determined from four subsequent intercourse attempts. Seventy-eight subjects with a mean age of 33.2 +/- 8.3 years and a geometric mean IELT of 15.9 +/- 2.3 seconds were enrolled. The mean SHIM score for all subjects was 20.4 +/- 6.0. Fifty-two subjects (66.7%) have SHIM scores of>21 (mean 24.3 +/- 1.1), consistent with normal erectile function, and a geometric mean IELT of 18.3 +/- 2.2 seconds. Twenty-six subjects (33.3%) had SHIM scores<22 (mean 12.7 +/- 3.7), consistent with a false positive diagnosis of ED, and a geometric mean IELT of 10.5 +/- 2.3 seconds. The incidence of false positive SHIM diagnosis of ED (SHIM<22) was inversely related to the IELT. Although the geometric mean IELT for subjects with SHIM scores<22 was significantly less than that of all subjects and subjects with SHIM scores>21, there were no significant differences between the geometric mean IELT or the IELT distribution of all subjects vs. the normal erectile function IELT (SHIM>21) cohort.\nQuestion: Screening for erectile dysfunction in men with lifelong premature ejaculation--Is the Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM) reliable?", "gt": "This study demonstrates a 33.3% false positive SHIM diagnosis of ED in men with PE.

The study indicates that a significant portion of men with lifelong PE (33.3%) received a false positive diagnosis of ED according to their SHIM scores, despite having normal erectile function. This suggests that the SHIM might not accurately differentiate between men with lifelong PE and those with both PE and ED, leading to potential misdiagnosis.\n\nThe study's findings highlight that there is an inverse relationship between SHIM scores and intravaginal ejaculation latency time (IELT), with lower SHIM scores associated with shorter IELT. However, it's noteworthy that there were no significant differences in IELT when comparing all subjects to those with SHIM scores indicative of normal erectile function. This implies that while SHIM scores can be misleading in men with lifelong PE, the actual erectile function, as indicated by IELT, remains unaffected.\n\nTherefore, in the context of men with lifelong PE, relying solely on the SHIM for diagnosing ED might not be advisable due to the risk of false positive results. Additional clinical evaluation and possibly other diagnostic tools may be necessary to accurately assess erectile function in this specific patient group."}

A total of 99 patients with an acute anterior circulation vessel occlusion who underwent IV thrombolysis were included. All patients had a standardized admission and follow-up procedure. Color-coded duplex sonography was performed on admission, 30 minutes after thrombolysis, and at 6 and 24 hours after onset of symptoms. Recanalization was classified as complete, partial, and absent. Functional outcome was rated with the modified Rankin Scale on day 30. Complete recanalization occurred significantly more frequently in patients with multiple branch occlusions compared to those with mainstem occlusion (OR 5.33; 95% CI, 2.18 to 13.05; p<0.0001) and was associated with lower NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores (p<0.001).

EF was assessed prospectively on a 5-point scale: (i) full erections; (ii) diminished erections routinely sufficient for intercourse; (iii) partial erections occasionally satisfactory for intercourse; (iv) partial erections unsatisfactory for intercourse; and (v) no erections. From 01/1999 to 01/2007, 136 preoperatively potent (levels 1-2) men who underwent BNS RP without prior treatment and who had not recovered consistently functional erections (levels 1-2) at 24 months had further follow-up regarding EF. Median follow-up after the 2-year visit was 36.0 months. Recovery of improved erections at a later date: recovery of EF level 1-2 in those with level 3 EF at 2 years and recovery of EF level 1-3 in those with level 4-5 EF at 2 years. The actuarial rates of further improved recovery of EF to level 1-2 in those with level 3 EF at 2 years and to level 1-3 in those with level 4-5 EF at 2 years were 8%, 20%, and 23% at 3, 4, and 5 years postoperatively, and 5%, 17%, and 21% at 3, 4, and 5 years postoperatively, respectively.

Comparisons were made between the SN+ and SN- subgroups with respect to overall survival, progression-free survival (PFS), and metastases-free survival (MFS) using the log rank test. Cox multivariate proportional hazards regression analysis was used to determine the effect of several potential confounding variables, including histology (squamous vs. nonsquamous), age (>60 vs.<or = 60), Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) (<90 vs.>or = 90), weight loss (>or = 5% vs.<5%), and gender.

We identified all singleton fetuses with known sex undergoing genetic sonography at 17 weeks' to 21 weeks 6 days' gestation in a single perinatal center from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2003. Markers studied were biparietal diameter/femur length, transcerebellar diameter, ear length, echogenic bowel, femur length, humerus length, absent middle fifth phalanx, nuchal fold, renal pelvis dilatation, echogenic cardiac focus, and choroid plexus cysts. Additional information extracted from the prospectively ascertained database included maternal age, referral indications, and chromosomal analyses. Multiple gestations and fetuses with structural or chromosomal abnormalities were excluded. The study received exempt review status by the Institutional Review Board. Dichotomous variables were compared by the chi(2) or Fisher exact test; continuous variables were compared by the unpaired t test. In total, 4057 eligible fetuses, 2103 male and 1954 female, were examined at 18.9 +/- 0.9 weeks (mean +/- SD). Referral indications included maternal age of 35 years or older (n = 2983), abnormal second-trimester serum screen results (n = 610), soft marker on sonography (n = 583), prior aneuploid offspring (n = 24), and other (n = 125). More than 1 referral indication was possible for a given fetus. Overall, male fetuses exhibited echogenic fetal bowel (odds ratio, 1.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14-2.72; P = .009) and renal pelvis dilatation (odds ratio, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.30-3.09; P = .001) significantly more often than female fetuses. However, when fetuses were evaluated for single isolated markers, only male predominance of renal pelvis dilatation persisted (odds ratio, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.32-4.09; P = .003).

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Enteroviruses are seasonally prevalent each year in Southeast Asia. Elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels have been noted in minor populations of patients, and antibiotics may be prescribed under the impression of a suspected bacterial infection. This prescription might be inappropriate, resulting in further bacterial resistance and medical expense. The aim of this study was to delineate how effective antibiotics are for children suffering from enterovirus infection complicated with a high CRP level. The medical records of children hospitalized between January 2008 and December 2012 with herpangina or hand, foot and mouth disease were reviewed retrospectively. The children enrolled were divided into three groups, A, B, and C, by CRP level, which were<40, 40-80, and \u2265 80 mg/l, respectively. A case-control study of group C divided into subgroups according to the prescription of antibiotics for at least 24h during the admission was conducted for further analysis. A total 3566 cases were identified; 214 were in group C and 71.0% of them received a prescription for antibiotics. There was a linear trend between a relatively higher CRP level and a higher proportion of antibiotics prescribed in the three groups (p=0.001). In the case-control study, there were no significant differences in age, sex, mean CRP, or febrile days. However, a relatively longer stay of hospitalization was recorded in the subgroup with an antibiotic prescription (p=0.020).\nQuestion: Are antibiotics beneficial to children suffering from enterovirus infection complicated with a high C-reactive protein level?", "gt": "The present study indicated that antibiotics might not be beneficial in treating these patients, even those with a high CRP level.

Children were categorized into groups based on their CRP levels, with group C having the highest levels (\u2265 80 mg/l). Among these, 71.0% received antibiotics, potentially under the assumption of a concurrent bacterial infection due to the elevated CRP levels.\n\nHowever, the case-control study within group C, which compared children who received antibiotics to those who did not, found no significant differences in age, sex, mean CRP, or febrile days between the two groups. The only notable difference was that the subgroup receiving antibiotics had a longer hospital stay (p=0.020). This suggests that the prescription of antibiotics did not lead to faster recovery or shorter hospitalization, which are common indicators of treatment efficacy in such cases.\n\nTherefore, the results imply that antibiotics may not be beneficial and could potentially lead to longer hospital stays, which could be associated with unnecessary medical expenses and the risk of contributing to antibiotic resistance. This study highlights the importance of careful consideration before prescribing antibiotics in cases of enterovirus infections, especially when elevated CRP levels are present, as they might not necessarily indicate a bacterial co-infection."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Many researchers have speculated that markers of malnutrition such as albumin, prealbumin, cholesterol, and transferrin are influenced by inflammation. The mechanism of this interaction has not been well understood. This was a prospective cross-sectional study. We evaluated 72 male patients older than 60 years admitted to a geriatric rehabilitation unit. Subjects with severe hepatic or renal diseases were excluded. We measured body mass index, caloric intake, serum albumin, prealbumin, cholesterol, transferrin, hemoglobin, and total lymphocyte count. To detect inflammation, we measured C-reactive protein, Westergren sedimentation rate, fibrinogen, and cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), IL-6, IL-2, and the soluble IL-2 receptor. Soluble IL-2 receptor was negatively associated with albumin (r = -.479, p<.0001), prealbumin (r = -.520, p =<.0001), cholesterol (r = -.487, p = .0001), transferrin (r = -.455, p = .0002), and hemoglobin (r = -.371, p = .002). TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, and IL-2 were not associated with these measures.\nQuestion: Is malnutrition overdiagnosed in older hospitalized patients?", "gt": "Inflammation increases the incidence of hypoalbuminemia and hypocholesterolemia, potentially leading to overdiagnosis of malnutrition.

Instead, it focuses on the relationship between markers of malnutrition (such as albumin, prealbumin, cholesterol, and transferrin) and inflammation, as measured by various inflammatory markers including C-reactive protein, sedimentation rate, fibrinogen, and cytokines. The study indicates that there is a negative association between the soluble IL-2 receptor (a marker of inflammation) and several nutritional markers, suggesting that inflammation may influence the levels of these markers.\n\nOverdiagnosis of malnutrition would imply that based on the nutritional markers, more patients are diagnosed with malnutrition than actually have it. The context suggests that inflammation could affect the levels of these markers, which might lead to misinterpretation of nutritional status if inflammation is not considered. However, to conclude whether malnutrition is overdiagnosed, one would need data comparing the true nutritional status (perhaps assessed by a gold standard method) with the diagnoses made using the markers mentioned. The study does not provide such a comparison, hence it does not directly answer the question about overdiagnosis."}

A mediation analysis of an experimental study. Perceived vulnerability to and worry about cervical cancer, and intention to stop smoking in the next month. Questionnaires were completed by 172 (71%) women at 2-week follow-up. Compared with women in the control group, those in the intervention group had higher perceptions of vulnerability, worry, and intention to stop smoking. Personal vulnerability (p<.01) and comparative vulnerability (p<.05) were significant mediators of the relationship between study group and intention to stop smoking.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Accelerated coronary artery disease (ACAD), a serious consequence after heart transplantation, is characterized by diffuse, concentric myointimal proliferation in the arteries. Increasing evidence supports the existence of a local renin-angiotensin system and the role of angiotensin-II in smooth muscle cell proliferation. We investigated the effect of angiotensin-II blocker candesartan and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril on experimental ACAD in a rat model. After heterotopic cardiac transplantation (Fisher to Lewis), recipients received 20 mg/kg/day candesartan or 40 mg/kg/day enalapril per os. Two groups of animals received additional pre-treatment with candesartan or enalapril 7 days before transplantation, and treatment was continued after grafting. All study groups including the controls received 3 mg/kg/day of sub-cutaneous cyclosporine for immunosuppression. A syngeneic group (Lewis to Lewis), serving as extra control, did not receive any treatment. Eighty days after grafting, we assessed the extent of ACAD in large and small arteries, using digitizing morphometry and expressed as mean vascular occlusion (MVO). In enalapril and candesartan pre- and post-treated animals, we observed significant reduction of MVO of intramyocardial arteries compared with the cyclosporine group (p<0.005), to levels similar to the syngeneic transplants. MVO of epicardial arteries in enalapril and candesartan pre- or posttreated animals did not significantly differ from cyclosporine controls (p>0.05).\nQuestion: Do vascular compartments differ in the development of chronic rejection?", "gt": "Our results support the hypothesis of 2 proliferative compartments in the development of ACAD, with differing receptor or enzyme distribution: the compartment of small, intramyocardial arteries in which ACAD can be reduced by ACE or AT(1) blockade, and that of large, epicardial arteries in which inhibition fails.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the information provided, it appears that different vascular compartments do indeed differ in the development of chronic rejection, specifically in the context of accelerated coronary artery disease (ACAD) after heart transplantation. The study indicates that treatment with either candesartan or enalapril led to a significant reduction in mean vascular occlusion (MVO) in intramyocardial arteries compared to the cyclosporine group alone. This reduction was to levels similar to those observed in syngeneic transplants, which are typically not subject to immune-mediated rejection. However, for epicardial arteries, the MVO in animals treated with enalapril or candesartan did not significantly differ from the cyclosporine controls. This suggests that the development of chronic rejection, as measured by MVO, varies between intramyocardial and epicardial arteries, with intramyocardial arteries showing a more pronounced response to treatment aimed at blocking the renin-angiotensin system."}

Although agriculture has the potential to be a strong driver of undernutrition reduction and serves as the main source of livelihood for over half of South Asia's population, its potential to reduce undernutrition is currently not being realized. The Leveraging Agriculture for Nutrition in South Asia (LANSA) research consortium seeks to understand how agriculture and agrifood systems can be better designed to improve nutrition in South Asia. In 2013 and 2014, LANSA carried out interviews with stakeholders influential in, and/or knowledgeable of, agriculture-nutrition policy in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, to gain a better understanding of the institutional and political factors surrounding the nutrition sensitivity of agriculture in the region. Semistructured interviews were carried out in India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan with a total of 56 stakeholders representing international organizations, research, government, civil society, donors, and the private sector. The findings point to mixed perspectives on countries' policy sensitivity toward nutrition.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Depression is a common problem, often being recurrent or becoming chronic. The National Service Framework for Mental Health (published by the Department of Health, 1999) states that people with depression should continue to be predominantly managed in primary care. There is much evidence that the detection and management of depression by GPs could be improved, but little work has focused on GPs' views of their work with depressed patients. This was a qualitative study exploring GP attitudes to the management of patients with depression. Views of GPs in socio-economically deprived areas are compared with those serving more affluent populations. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with two groups of GPs in north-west England. One group of GPs (22) were practising in inner-city areas, and a second group (13) in suburban and semi-rural practices. All were Principals in practices that participated in undergraduate teaching. The interviews were audio-taped and subsequently transcribed verbatim. Analysis was by constant comparison until category saturation of each theme was achieved. Subjects conceptualized depression as an everyday problem of practice, rather than as an objective diagnostic category. Thematic coding of their accounts suggests a tension between three kinds of views of depressed people: (i) That depression is a common and normal response to life events or change and that it reflects the medicalization of these conditions; (ii) That the label or diagnosis of depression offers a degree of secondary gain to both patients and doctors, particularly to those GPs practising in inner-city areas and (iii) That inner-city GPs experienced on-going management of depressed people as an interactional problem, in contrast to those GPs serving a less deprived population who saw depression as a treatable illness and as rewarding work for the GP.\nQuestion: Managing depression in primary care: another example of the inverse care law?", "gt": "Depression is commonly presented to GPs who feel that the diagnosis often involves the separation of a normal reaction to environment and true illness. For those patients living in socio-economically deprived environments, the problems, and therefore the depression, are seen to be insoluble. This has an important implication for the construction of educational interventions around improving the recognition and treatment of depression in primary care: some doctors may be reluctant to recognize and respond to such patients in depth because of the much wider structural and social factors that we have suggested in this paper. That it is the doctors working with deprived populations who express these views, means that the 'Inverse care law' [Tudor Hart J. The inverse care Law. Lancet 1971; 1(7696): 405-412] operates in the management of depression.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "The inverse care law, as described by Julian Tudor Hart in 1971, posits that the availability of good medical care tends to vary inversely with the needs of the population served. In other words, areas with higher need for medical care often receive less of it, while areas with lower need often receive more.\n\nBased on the provided context, there are indications that managing depression in primary care might align with the inverse care law. The study highlights differences in how general practitioners (GPs) in socio-economically deprived areas versus those in more affluent areas perceive and manage depression. GPs in inner-city areas, which are often socio-economically deprived, view the management of depression as an interactional problem, suggesting potential challenges in providing adequate care. In contrast, GPs in suburban and semi-rural practices, typically serving less deprived populations, see depression management as a treatable condition and rewarding work. This contrast could reflect the inverse care law, where the perceived complexity and less rewarding nature of treating depression in more deprived areas might correlate with less effective management, despite the higher need for such care in these communities."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Several studies have reported higher prevalence of obesity in patients suffering from bipolar disorder (BD). To study the relation of elevated body mass index (BMI) in patients with BD more closely, we investigated differences in sociodemographic, clinical, and medical characteristics with respect to BMI, with the hypothesis that BMI is related to prognosis and outcome. We measured the BMI of 276 subjects of a tertiary care sample from the Maritime Bipolar Registry. Subjects were 16 to 83 years old, with psychiatric diagnoses of bipolar I disorder (n = 186), bipolar II disorder (n = 85), and BD not otherwise specified (n = 5). The registry included basic demographic data and details of the clinical presentation. We first examined the variables showing a significant association with BMI; subsequently, we modeled the relationship between BMI and psychiatric outcome using structural equation analysis. The prevalence of obesity in our sample was 39.1%. We found higher BMI in subjects with a chronic course (p<0.001) and longer duration of illness (p = 0.02), lower scores on the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (p = 0.02), and on disability (p = 0.002).

Additionally, overweight patients had more frequent comorbid conditions such as subthreshold social anxiety disorders, generalized anxiety disorders, diabetes mellitus type II, and hypertension. The study also found that patients who achieved complete remission of symptoms on lithium therapy had significantly lower BMI.\n\nThese findings suggest that BMI may serve as a marker for certain aspects of prognosis and outcome in BD, such as the chronicity of the illness, functional impairment, and the presence of comorbid conditions. However, it's important to note that while BMI shows associations with these outcomes, the study used structural equation modeling to explore the relationship between BMI and psychiatric outcomes, which implies a complex relationship that is not purely predictive but rather interrelated with other factors. Therefore, while BMI can provide some insight into the prognosis and outcome of BD, it should be considered alongside other clinical and sociodemographic variables."}

A national cross-sectional web survey was conducted in Italy from April through September 2012. 722 PCPs completed the questionnaire. The great majority indicated the correct proportion of smokers among patients with lung cancer, the smoking abstention required for risk reduction after smoking cessation, and tobacco as a known major risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), whereas 28.7% knew the Fagerstrom test for the assessment of nicotine dependence. Almost all PCPs reported that they ask all patients if they smoke, inform about the dangers of smoking and recommend to quit smoking, whereas prescription of recommended drugs for smoking cessation varied from 37.7% for nicotine replacement therapy to 4.9% for varenicline.\nQuestion: Are primary care physicians prepared to assist patients for smoking cessation?", "gt": "Despite a positive attitude, Italian PCPs are not prepared to deliver effective interventions for smoking cessation in their patients.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the information provided, primary care physicians (PCPs) in Italy exhibit a significant level of preparedness to assist patients in smoking cessation efforts, but there is still room for improvement.

They also correctly identified the proportion of smokers among patients with lung cancer. However, a smaller percentage (28.7%) were aware of the Fagerstrom test, which is used to assess nicotine dependence. This suggests that while there is a strong foundation of knowledge, there is also a need for further education on specific assessment tools.\n\nIn terms of attitudes and activities, the survey indicates a positive stance among PCPs towards smoking cessation. Almost all PCPs reported that they routinely ask their patients about smoking habits, inform them about the dangers of smoking, and recommend quitting. This indicates a proactive approach towards smoking cessation counseling. However, the prescription of recommended medications for smoking cessation varied widely, with a notable difference in the rates of prescribing nicotine replacement therapy (37.7%) compared to varenicline (4.9%). This disparity suggests that while some pharmacological interventions are more commonly utilized, there is a need to increase the use of all recommended therapies to enhance the effectiveness of smoking cessation programs.\n\nIn summary, while primary care physicians in Italy are prepared to some extent to assist their patients in smoking cessation efforts, there are areas where their knowledge and practices could be strengthened to provide more comprehensive support."}

Based on the context provided, several key points emerge regarding the dilemma of whether to intervene or not:\n\n1. **Positive Attitude Towards Assistance**: Despite the barriers, there is a general positive attitude towards helping peers who have overdosed. This suggests a foundational willingness to act, which can be a critical factor in overcoming some of the hesitations.\n\n2. **Barriers to Acting**:\n   - **Personal High**: If the witness is under the influence of heroin themselves, their ability to assess the situation and act effectively can be impaired.\n   - **Assessment Difficulty**: Determining the seriousness of the overdose can be challenging, leading to hesitation or delayed action.\n   - **Empathy and Disruption**: There may be a reluctance to \"disturb\" someone else's high, reflecting a complex mixture of empathy and the social norms within the drug-using community.\n   - **Motive Uncertainty**: Doubt about whether the overdose was intentional or unintentional, and whether the person wants help, can create hesitation.\n   - **Fear of Police Involvement**: The fear of legal repercussions can significantly deter individuals from calling for help or taking action that might attract law enforcement attention.\n\n3. **Decision-Making Process**: The decision to act or not is influenced by a balance between these barriers and the willingness to help. In situations where the barriers are perceived as too high, action might be avoided. Conversely, if the perceived benefits of helping (such as saving a life) outweigh the barriers, the witness is more likely to act.\n\nIn essence, the decision to act or not in the case of an overdose among heroin users is a nuanced one, shaped by a mix of personal, social, and legal factors. Understanding and addressing these factors could be crucial in developing strategies to encourage more effective responses to overdoses, potentially saving lives."}

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the W-plasty technique to prevent these two complications. Animals were divided into a study and a control group. Each group consisted of 6 animals. In the control group, we performed a 5-cm tracheal segment resection, and then reconstruction was performed with an interrupted technique with 6/0 Prolene sutures. In the study group, we used the W-plasty technique with 6/0 Prolene interrupted sutures. The animals were sacrificed on the 30th day postoperatively and tracheal resection including the entire anastomosis site was performed. The traction and pullout test was applied to each specimen and all the specimens were analysed histopathologically. The intraluminal diameter and the thickness of the tracheal wall at the level of anastomoses were measured by using a micrometer. The pattern of the reaction and localization were recorded. The traction and pullout test results were 131.6 +/- 4.3 g and 187.5 +/- 6.4 g in the control and the study group, respectively, which was a significant difference (p = 0.004).

In the context provided, the technique is employed to potentially reduce excessive tension at the anastomosis site, thereby preventing complications. The study suggests that the W-plasty technique shows promise in improving outcomes in tracheal reconstruction by enhancing the tensile strength of the anastomosis and possibly reducing inflammation and fibrosis, as evidenced by the traction and pullout test results and histopathological analysis.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: To examine the health consequences of exposure to income inequality. Secondary analysis employing data from several publicly available sources. Measures of individual health status and other individual characteristics are obtained from the March Current Population Survey (CPS). State-level income inequality is measured by the Gini coefficient based on family income, as reported by the U.S. Census Bureau and Al-Samarrie and Miller (1967). State-level mortality rates are from the Vital Statistics of the United States, other state-level characteristics are from U.S. census data as reported in the Statistical Abstract of the United States. We examine the effects of state-level income inequality lagged from 5 to 29 years on individual health by estimating probit models of poor/fair health status for samples of adults aged 25-74 in the 1995 through 1999 March CPS. We control for several individual characteristics, including educational attainment and household income, as well as regional fixed effects. We use multivariate regression to estimate the effects of income inequality lagged 10 and 20 years on state-level mortality rates for 1990, 1980, 1970, and 1960. Lagged income inequality is not significantly associated with individual health status after controlling for regional fixed effects. Lagged income inequality is not associated with all cause mortality, but associated with reduced mortality from cardiovascular disease and malignant neoplasms, after controlling for state fixed-effects.\nQuestion: Is exposure to income inequality a public health concern?", "gt": "In contrast to previous studies that fail to control for regional variations in health outcomes, we find little support for the contention that exposure to income inequality is detrimental to either individual or population health.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the context provided, the analysis does not conclusively indicate that exposure to income inequality is a direct public health concern regarding individual health status or overall mortality rates. The study found that lagged income inequality, when accounting for regional fixed effects, did not have a significant association with individual health status as measured by self-reported poor/fair health status among adults aged 25-74. Furthermore, while income inequality was not associated with all-cause mortality, there were some associations with reduced mortality from specific causes, such as cardiovascular disease and malignant neoplasms, after controlling for state-level fixed effects.\n\nThese findings suggest that the relationship between income inequality and health outcomes might be more complex than a direct negative impact. The lack of a significant association with individual health status and overall mortality, and the nuanced relationship with specific causes of mortality, imply that while income inequality could play a role in public health, its effects are not straightforward and may be influenced by various other factors. Therefore, while income inequality might still be considered a social issue with potential indirect health implications, the provided evidence does not strongly support it as a direct public health concern based on the measures and methods used in this study."}

Free-T3, Free-T4, TSH, antithyroperoxidase and antithyroglobulin antibodies, total immunoglobulin (Ig)E, Rheuma test and eritro-sedimentation rate were monitored during treatment. In 16 patients a strong decrease of urticaria symptoms has happened after 12 weeks. The TPO Ab and HTG Ab clearly decreased in 14 patients.

The aims of this study were to evaluate the feasibility of ESD for nonpedunculated SICC and to determine the need for subsequent surgery after ESD. A total of 150 patients with nonpedunculated SICC in resected specimens after ESD were analyzed. Among them, 75 patients underwent subsequent surgery after ESD. Clinical outcomes of ESD and histopathological risk factors for lymph node (LN) metastasis were evaluated. The en-bloc resection and complete resection (R0) rates of ESD were 98% (147/150) and 95.3% (143/150), respectively. None of the patients had delayed bleeding after ESD. Perforations occurred in seven patients (4.7%), which were successfully treated by endoscopic clipping. After subsequent surgery for 75 patients, LN metastases were found in 10 cases (13.3%). The incidence of LN metastasis was significantly higher in tumors featuring submucosal invasion of at least 1500 \u03bcm, lymphovascular invasion, and tumor budding. Multivariate analysis showed that lymphovascular invasion (P=0.034) and tumor budding (P=0.015) were significantly associated with LN metastasis.

Women who had undergone pregnancy under the care of the Adult Congenital Heart Disease Unit at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital were retrospectively identified and matched to separate male and nulliparous female controls. Functional status (New York Health Association [NYHA]), RV function, and systemic atrioventricular valve regurgitation were recorded for each group at baseline, postpregnancy (or at 1 year for control groups) and at latest follow-up. Eighteen women had 31 pregnancies (range 1-4) resulting in 32 live births. There were no maternal but one neonatal death. At baseline, there was no significant difference in NYHA class or RV function between pregnancy and control groups.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: In recent years, due to a high persistence, biomagnification in food webs, presence in remote regions, and potential toxicity, perfluorochemicals (PFCs) have generated a considerable interest. The present study was aimed to determine the levels of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and other PFCs in drinking water (tap and bottled) and river water samples from Tarragona Province (Catalonia, Spain). Municipal drinking (tap) water samples were collected from the four most populated towns in the Tarragona Province, whereas samples of bottled waters were purchased from supermarkets. River water samples were collected from the Ebro (two samples), Cortiella, and Francol\u00ed Rivers. After pretreatment, PFC analyses were performed by HPLC-MS. Quantification was done using the internal standard method, with recoveries between 68% and 118%. In tap water, PFOS and PFOA levels ranged between 0.39 and 0.87 ng/L (0.78 and 1.74 pmol/L) and between 0.32 and 6.28 ng/L (0.77 and 15.2 pmol/L), respectively. PFHpA, PFHxS, and PFNA were also other detected PFCs. PFC levels were notably lower in bottled water, where PFOS could not be detected in any sample. Moreover, PFHpA, PFHxS, PFOA, PFNA, PFOS, PFOSA, and PFDA could be detected in the river water samples. PFOS and PFOA concentrations were between<0.24 and 5.88 ng/L (<0.48 and 11.8 pmol/L) and between<0.22 and 24.9 ng/L (<0.53 and 60.1 pmol/L), respectively. Assuming a human water consumption of 2 L per day, the daily intake of PFOS and PFOA by the population of the area under evaluation was calculated (0.78-1.74 and 12.6 ng, respectively). It was found that drinking water might be a source of exposure to PFCs as important as the dietary intake of these pollutants.\nQuestion: Levels of perfluorochemicals in water samples from Catalonia, Spain: is drinking water a significant contribution to human exposure?", "gt": "The contribution of drinking water (tap and bottled) to the human daily intake of various PFCs has been compared for the first time with data from dietary intake of these PFCs. It was noted that in certain cases, drinking water can be a source of exposure to PFCs as important as the dietary intake of these pollutants although the current concentrations were similar or lower than those reported in the literature for surface water samples from a number of regions and countries.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the study conducted in the Tarragona Province of Catalonia, Spain, it was found that drinking water can indeed be a significant contributor to human exposure to perfluorochemicals (PFCs), particularly perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). The research analyzed tap water, bottled water, and river water samples, detecting varying levels of PFCs. Notably, PFOS and PFOA were found in tap water at concentrations ranging from 0.39 to 0.87 ng/L and 0.32 to 6.28 ng/L, respectively. In bottled water, PFOS was undetectable, and while PFOA and other PFCs were detected, their levels were notably lower compared to tap water. River water also contained PFCs, with PFOS and PFOA concentrations ranging from <0.24 to 5.88 ng/L and <0.22 to 24.9 ng/L, respectively.\n\nAssuming a daily water consumption of 2 liters, the study estimated the daily intake of PFOS and PFOA from drinking water to be 0.78-1.74 ng and 12.6 ng, respectively. This indicates that, at least in terms of the PFCs analyzed, drinking water could contribute significantly to human exposure, potentially making it a source of exposure that is as important as dietary intake. Therefore, drinking water is indeed a significant contribution to human exposure to these specific PFCs in the region studied."}

This retrospective analysis of SKPTs from January 2002 through January 2007 compared outcomes between patients with absent or low C-peptide levels (<2.0 ng/mL, group A) with those having levels>or =2.0 ng/mL (group B). Among 74 SKPTs, 67 were in group A and seven in group B (mean C-peptide level 5.7 ng/mL). During transplantation, group B subjects were older (mean age 51 vs 41 years, P = .006); showed a later age of onset of diabetes (median 35 vs 13 years, P = .0001); weighed more (median 77 vs 66 kg, P = .24); had a greater proportion of African-Americans (57% vs 13%, P = .004); and had a longer pretransplant duration of dialysis (median 40 vs 14 months, P = .14). With similar median follow-up of 40 months, death-censored kidney (95% group A vs 100% group B, P = NS) and pancreas (87% group A vs 100% group B, P = NS) graft survival rates were similar, but patient survival (94% group A vs 71% group B, P = .03) was greater in group A.

This suggests that while graft survival does not seem to be influenced by pretransplant C-peptide levels, patient survival might be, with patients having lower pretransplant C-peptide levels showing better survival outcomes.\n\nOverall, the study indicates that pretransplant C-peptide levels do not significantly impact the survival rates of the transplanted organs, but they may influence patient survival, although the reasons for this are not explicitly explained in the provided context."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: We sought to study the individual and integrative role of amino-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and parameters of renal function for prognosis in heart failure. Amino-terminal pro-BNP and renal impairment both predict death in patients with heart failure. Worsening of renal function in heart failure even defines the \"cardiorenal syndrome.\" Seven hundred twenty subjects presenting with acute heart failure from 4 university-affiliated medical centers were dichotomized according to NT-proBNP concentration and baseline glomerular filtration rate. In addition, patients were divided according to changes in renal function. The primary end point was 60-day mortality. The combination of a glomerular filtration rate (GFR)<60 ml/min/1.73 m2 with an NT-proBNP>4,647 pg/ml was the best predictor of 60-day mortality (odds ratio 3.46; 95% confidence interval 2.13 to 5.63). Among subjects with an NT-proBNP above the median, those with a GFR<60 ml/min/1.73 m2 or a creatinine rise>or =0.3 mg/dl had the worst prognosis, whereas in subjects with a NT-proBNP below the median, prognosis was not influenced by either impaired renal function at presentation or the development of renal impairment during admission.\nQuestion: Amino-terminal pro-brain natriuretic Peptide, renal function, and outcomes in acute heart failure: redefining the cardiorenal interaction?", "gt": "The combination of NT-proBNP with measures of renal function better predicts short-term outcome in acute heart failure than either parameter alone.

Specifically, the combination of a lower glomerular filtration rate (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) and higher NT-proBNP levels (>4,647 pg/ml) was identified as the best predictor of 60-day mortality, indicating a strong association between renal impairment and elevated NT-proBNP levels in predicting adverse outcomes.\n\nThis research underscores the importance of considering both NT-proBNP and renal function parameters together, rather than in isolation, when assessing prognosis in patients with acute heart failure. This integrated approach could lead to more accurate risk stratification and potentially influence clinical management strategies, emphasizing the necessity of a holistic view of the cardiorenal interaction in acute heart failure settings."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: The increasing incidence of hip fractures in our aging population challenges orthopedic surgeons and hospital administrators to effectively care for these patients. Many patients present to regional hospitals and are transferred to tertiary care centres for surgical management, resulting in long delays to surgery. Providing timely care may improve outcomes, as delay carries an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. We retrospectively reviewed the cases of all patients with hip fractures treated in a single Level 1 trauma centre in Canada between 2005 and 2012. We compared quality indicators and outcomes between patients transferred from a peripheral hospital and those directly admitted to the trauma centre. Of the 1191 patients retrospectively reviewed, 890 met our inclusion criteria: 175 who were transferred and 715 admitted directly to the trauma centre. Transfer patients' median delay from admission to operation was 93 hours, whereas nontransfer patients waited 44 hours (p<0.001). The delay predominantly occurred before transfer, as the patients had to wait for a bed to become available at the trauma centre. The median length of stay in hospital was 20 days for transfer patients compared with 13 days for nontransfer patients (p<0.001). Regional policy changes enacted in 2011 decreased the median transfer delay from regional hospital to tertiary care centre from 47 to 27 hours (p = 0.005).\nQuestion: A comparison of surgical delays in directly admitted versus transferred patients with hip fractures: opportunities for improvement?", "gt": "Policy changes can have a significant impact on patient care.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: With the development of high-performance computer programs, transcutaneous electrogastrography has experienced a renaissance in the last few years and is widely recommended as a non-invasive diagnostic tool to evaluate functional gastric disorders. We assessed the clinical value of electrogastrography in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients after a variety of procedures of the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Electrogastrography tracings were recorded with a commercially available data logger using a recording frequency of 4 Hz. A standard meal was given between a 60 min preprandial and a 60 min postprandial period. The following parameters were analyzed pre- and postprandially utilizing Fourier and spectral analysis: Regular gastric activity (2-4 cycles/minute), bradygastria (0.5-2 cycles/minute), tachygastria (4-9 cycles/minute), dominant frequency and power of the dominant frequency. Nineteen asymptomatic healthy volunteers served as a control group. Forty-nine patients, who had undergone upper intestinal surgery, were included in the study (cholecystectomy n = 10, Nissen fundoplication n = 10, subtotal gastrectomy n = 8, truncal vagotomy, and gastric pull-up as esophageal replacement n = 6). Twenty of these patients complained of epigastric symptoms post-operatively, while 12 of these 20 patients also had a scintigraphic gastric emptying study with Tc99m labeled semisolid meal. Preprandial gastric electric activity was between 2 and 4 cycles/minute in 60-90% of the study time in healthy volunteers. In all study groups the prevalence and power of normal electric activity increased significantly after the test meal (p<0.001). After cholecystectomy, Nissen fundoplication, subtotal gastrectomy or vagotomy and gastric pull-up pre- and postprandial gastric electric activity showed a greater variability compared to normal volunteers (p<0.05), but no typical electrogastrography pattern could be identified for the different surgical procedures. There was no significant difference in the electrogastrography pattern between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients and patients with normal or abnormal scintigraphic gastric emptying curves.\nQuestion: Transcutaneous electrogastrography: a non-invasive method to evaluate post-operative gastric disorders?", "gt": "There is no specific electrogastrography pattern to differentiate between typical surgical procedures or epigastric symptoms.

The EGG tracings were recorded using a commercially available data logger, and the analysis included parameters such as regular gastric activity, bradygastria, tachygastria, dominant frequency, and power of the dominant frequency.\n\nThe study found that preprandial gastric electrical activity in the control group (asymptomatic healthy volunteers) was predominantly between 2 and 4 cycles per minute, which is considered normal. In contrast, patients who had undergone upper intestinal surgery showed a greater variability in their pre- and postprandial gastric electrical activity compared to the control group. However, the study did not identify a specific EGG pattern that could be uniquely associated with the different types of surgical procedures.\n\nImportantly, the study also found no significant differences in the EGG patterns between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients, nor between patients with normal and abnormal scintigraphic gastric emptying curves. This suggests that while EGG can detect changes in gastric electrical activity post-operatively, it may not reliably distinguish between patients with and without symptoms or between those with normal and abnormal gastric emptying.\n\nIn summary, while transcutaneous electrogastrography is a non-invasive method that can detect changes in gastric electrical activity after upper GI surgery, its ability to specifically diagnose post-operative gastric disorders or correlate with symptomatology and gastric emptying patterns appears to be limited based on this study."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Poststroke depression (PSD) is the most common neuropsychiatric consequence of stroke. A large number of studies have focused on the pathogenesis of PSD, but only a few aimed to characterize its psychopathology; these studies yielded results that are difficult to compare because of the different methods utilized. The current study aimed to characterize the symptom profile of PSD in an attempt to better understand the disease and allow a more accurate diagnosis. The study sample comprised 64 patients divided into three groups: stroke patients without diagnosis of depression (n = 33), stroke patients diagnosed with PSD (PSD group, n = 14) and patients diagnosed with major depression (MD) but with no clinical comorbidity (MD group, n = 17). All patients were diagnosed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I). The initial diagnostic interview was complemented by the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Rankin Scale, and four scales for the assessment of the intensity of symptoms of anxiety and depression: the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression General Scale (HADS), the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A). The Star Plot, a graphical method of data visualization, was used to analyze the results. The t test was used for independent samples (two-tailed analysis). As measured by the BDI, HAM-D and HAM-A scales and HADS depression subscale, the average total scores of symptoms for the sample of patients diagnosed with MD without clinical comorbidity was significantly higher than that of the PSD patients (p<0.05). Similar results were obtained by plotting the BDI data on Star Plot. The PSD patients showed mild typical depressive symptoms such as less depressed mood, anhedonia, disinterest, guilt, negative thoughts, depreciation, suicidal ideation and anxiety, when evaluated by the HAM-A scale. Moreover, the somatic symptoms of depression did not lead to increased diagnosis of major depression in stroke patients.\nQuestion: Is poststroke depression a major depression?", "gt": "The results indicate that the PSD clinical picture comprised, in general, symptoms of mild/moderate intensity, especially those considered as pillars for the diagnosis of depression: depressed mood, loss of pleasure and lack of interest. Given the imprecision of boundaries that separate the clinical forms of depression from subclinical and nonpathological forms, or even from the concepts of demoralization and adjustment disorders, we situate PSD in a complex biopsychosocial context in which a better understanding of its psychopathological profile could provide diagnostic and therapeutic alternatives best suited to the difficult reality experienced by stroke patients.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "Based on the information provided in the context, poststroke depression (PSD) is not classified as major depression, although there are some overlapping symptoms.

We evaluated 30 patients with impacted ureteral calculi, who were compared with a second unimpacted group matched for stone size and stone location. The calculi were reorganized into<or =10-mm and>10-mm groups. The results were compared in terms of clearance rates, number of shockwaves, number of sessions, and number of days between the start of SWL and clearance. Between January 1998 and December 2001, 30 impacted stones were treated with lithotripsy. Complete clearance rates in the impacted as well as the non-impacted group were 76.7%. There was no statistical difference in the number of shockwaves, sessions, or time to clearance.

In contrast, those who were in the top quartile for LES but did not meet MSA guidelines had a significantly lower HR of 0.54 (95% CI, 0.42-0.71; P<0.001), indicating a substantial reduction in all-cause mortality risk.\n\n3. The group that both met MSA guidelines and was in the top quartile for LES had the lowest HR of 0.28 (95% CI, 0.12-0.66; P=0.005), suggesting a strong protective effect against all-cause mortality.\n\n4. Further, individuals who met both MSA and moderate to vigorous physical activity guidelines and were in the top quartile for LES had an even lower HR of 0.23 (95% CI, 0.08-0.61; P=0.005).\n\nThese findings indicate that achieving higher levels of LES is more strongly associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality than merely meeting MSA guidelines. While meeting MSA guidelines is beneficial, the presence of high LES seems to be the key factor in reducing mortality risk."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Diabetes or insulin resistance, overweight, arterial hypertension, and dyslipidaemia are recognized risk factors for cardiovascular (CV) disease. However, their predictive value and hierarchy in elderly subjects remain uncertain. We investigated the impact of cardiometabolic risk factors on mortality in a prospective cohort study of 331 elderly high-risk subjects (mean age+/-SD: 85+/-7 years). Two-year total mortality was predicted by age, diabetes, low BMI, low diastolic blood pressure (DBP), low total and HDL cholesterol, and previous CV events. The effect of diabetes was explained by previous CV events. In non-diabetic subjects, mortality was predicted by high insulin sensitivity, determined by HOMA-IR and QUICKI indices. In multivariate analyses, the strongest mortality predictors were low BMI, low HDL cholesterol and previous myocardial infarction. Albumin, a marker of malnutrition, was associated with blood pressure, total and HDL cholesterol, and HOMA-IR. The inflammation marker CRP was associated with low total and HDL cholesterol, and high HOMA-IR.\nQuestion: Cardiometabolic determinants of mortality in a geriatric population: is there a \"reverse metabolic syndrome\"?", "gt": "In very old patients, low BMI, low DBP, low total and HDL cholesterol, and high insulin sensitivity predict total mortality, indicating a \"reverse metabolic syndrome\" that is probably attributable to malnutrition and/or chronic disorders. These inverse associations limit the relevance of conventional risk factors. Previous CV events and HDL cholesterol remain strong predictors of mortality. Future studies should determine if and when the prevention and treatment of malnutrition in the elderly should be incorporated into conventional CV prevention.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "The study you've described suggests a complex relationship between traditional cardiometabolic risk factors and mortality in elderly subjects, which might indeed point to a \"reverse metabolic syndrome\" phenomenon, especially in geriatric populations. This concept is somewhat contrary to the traditional understanding of metabolic syndrome, where conditions like obesity, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality.\n\nIn the elderly cohort studied, several factors were found to be predictive of mortality over a two-year period. These include:\n\n- **Age**: Naturally, older age is a strong predictor of mortality.\n- **Diabetes**: This is predictive of mortality, though its effect is explained by previous cardiovascular events.\n- **Low BMI**: A lower body mass index was found to be a strong predictor of mortality in this study, which contrasts with the usual association of higher BMI with increased risk of cardiovascular disease.\n- **Low Diastolic Blood Pressure**: This is another unexpected finding, as typically higher blood pressure is associated with increased cardiovascular risk.\n- **Low Total and HDL Cholesterol**: Both lower levels of total cholesterol and HDL (often referred to as \"good\" cholesterol) were linked to higher mortality. This again contrasts with the typical understanding that higher cholesterol levels are detrimental to health.\n- **Previous Cardiovascular Events**: A history of cardiovascular events is a strong predictor of mortality.\n- **High Insulin Sensitivity**: In non-diabetic subjects, higher insulin sensitivity (determined by HOMA-IR and QUICKI indices) was associated with higher mortality.\n\nThe study also noted associations between albumin, a marker of malnutrition, and various cardiometabolic markers such as blood pressure, total and HDL cholesterol, and HOMA-IR. Similarly, C-reactive protein (CRP), an indicator of inflammation, was associated with low cholesterol levels and high insulin resistance.\n\nThe findings suggest that in elderly populations, the traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease and mortality may not follow the same patterns as in younger or middle-aged adults. This could be due to the complex interplay of age-related physiological changes, chronic diseases, and the overall health status of the elderly. The term \"reverse metabolic syndrome\" might be used to describe this phenomenon, where the usual associations between metabolic factors and mortality are inverted in older adults, potentially due to underlying malnutrition, frailty, or other age-related conditions that affect metabolic profiles and health outcomes."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: It would be important to better identify heart failure (HF) patients most likely to respond to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). Because endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) play a crucial role in the maintenance of vascular endothelium integrity, we hypothesize that patients who have higher circulating EPCs levels have greater neovascularization potential and are more prone to be responders to CRT. Prospective study of 30 consecutive patients, scheduled for CRT. Echocardiographic evaluation was performed before implant and 6 months after. Responders to CRT were defined as patients who were still alive, have not been hospitalized for HF management, and demonstrated \u226515% reduction in left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV) at the 6-month follow-up. EPCs were quantified before CRT, from peripheral blood, by flow cytometry using five different conjugated antibodies: anti-CD34, anti-KDR, anti-CD133, anti-CD45, and anti-CXCR4. We quantified five different populations of angiogenic cells: CD133(+) /CD34(+) cells, CD133(+) /KDR(+) cells, CD133(+) /CD34(+) /KDR(+) cells, CD45(dim) CD34(+) /KDR(+) cells, and CD45(dim) CD34(+) /KDR(+) /CXCR4(+) cells. The proportion of responders to CRT at the 6-month follow-up was 46.7%. Responders to CRT presented higher baseline EPCs levels than nonresponders (0.0003 \u00b1 0.0006% vs 0.0001 \u00b1 0.0002%, P = 0.04, for CD34(+) /CD133(+) /KDR(+) and 0.0006 \u00b1 0.0005% vs 0.0003 \u00b1 0.0003%, P = 0.009, for CD45(dim) CD34(+) /KDR(+) /CXCR4(+) cells). In addition, baseline levels of CD45(dim) CD34(+) /KDR(+) /CXCR4(+) cells were positively correlated with the reduction of LVESV verified 6 months after CRT (r = 0.497, P = 0.008).\nQuestion: Circulating endothelial progenitor cells as a predictor of response to cardiac resynchronization therapy: the missing piece of the puzzle?", "gt": "High circulating EPCs levels may identify the subset of HF patients who are more likely to undergo reverse remodeling and benefit from CRT.

{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: The optimal management of patients with ureteric obstruction in advanced pelvic malignancy is unclear. Effective judgment is required to decide which patients would benefit most from decompression of the urinary tract. The objective of our study was to assess survival and complication rates post-percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) in patients with ureteric obstruction due to advanced pelvic malignancy. A detailed retrospective case review of all patients who underwent PCN for ureteric obstruction due to pelvic malignancy in one calendar year was conducted to assess indication, survival time, length of stay post-procedure and complications. Thirty-six nephrostomies were performed on 22 patients with prostate cancer being the commonest primary (55 %). Renal failure was the commonest mode of presentation (56 %). Eight patients (36 %) presented without a prior diagnosis of cancer. All PCNs except one were initially technically successful, and 56 % of renal units were able to be antegradely stented and rendered free of nephrostomy. Median survival post-nephrostomy was 78 days (range 4-1,137), with the subset of bladder cancer patients having the poorest survival. Dislodgement of the nephrostomy tube was the most common troublesome complication which led to the greatest morbidity, sometimes requiring repeat nephrostomy insertion. Patients stayed for a median of 23 (range 3-89) days in hospital, which amounted to 29 % of their remaining lifetime spent in hospital.\nQuestion: Percutaneous nephrostomy for ureteric obstruction due to advanced pelvic malignancy: have we got the balance right?", "gt": "Although effective in improving renal function, PCN is a procedure not without associated morbidity and does not always prolong survival. Therefore, the decision to decompress an obstructed kidney with advanced pelvic malignancy should not be taken lightly. We recommend that such cases be discussed in a multidisciplinary setting, and a decision is taken only after a full informed discussion involving patients and their relatives.", "tag": ["PubMedQA", "medical"], "source": "PubMedQA", "generated_output": "The question of whether percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) for ureteric obstruction due to advanced pelvic malignancy has the right balance involves weighing the benefits of urinary decompression against the associated risks and patient outcomes. Based on the provided study, we can analyze this balance through several key points:\n\n1. **Technical Success and Immediate Relief**: The study reports that all but one PCN were technically successful, indicating that the procedure is effective in achieving its primary goal of decompressing the urinary tract. This immediate relief can be crucial for patients experiencing renal failure, which was the most common reason for presentation in this study.\n\n2. **Complications and Morbidity**: Dislodgement of the nephrostomy tube was identified as the most common complication, leading to significant morbidity and sometimes necessitating repeat procedures. This complication can add to the patient's discomfort and the burden on healthcare resources.\n\n3. **Survival Outcomes**: The median survival post-PCN was 78 days, with bladder cancer patients having the poorest survival rates. This suggests that while PCN can provide temporary relief and potentially improve quality of life, it does not significantly extend survival in the context of advanced malignancies.\n\n4. **Hospital Stay and Quality of Life**: Patients spent a median of 23 days in the hospital post-PCN, which represents a significant portion (29%) of their remaining lifetime. This extended hospital stay can impact the patient's quality of life and also has implications for healthcare resource utilization.\n\n5. **Selection Criteria for PCN**: The study highlights that 36% of patients did not have a prior diagnosis of cancer, indicating that PCN may sometimes be performed in patients who are unaware of the underlying malignancy. This raises questions about the appropriateness of the procedure in such cases and the need for more definitive diagnosis before proceeding with decompression.\n\nIn conclusion, while PCN can provide immediate relief and potentially improve the quality of life for patients with ureteric obstruction due to advanced pelvic malignancy, the balance of benefits versus risks and the impact on survival and quality of life must be carefully considered. The high rate of complications, particularly dislodgement, and the significant hospital stay suggest that there may be a need for more refined criteria for selecting patients who are most likely to benefit from PCN. Additionally, efforts to minimize complications and to integrate PCN within a comprehensive palliative care plan could help optimize the balance of care for these patients."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Thyroid surgery is done in Germany in a considerable numbers of operations (about 110,000 per year). To perform thyroid operations by so called \"generalists\" or \"specialists\" have been discussed intensively, however, this issue have not been analyzed in detail. Study material comprised 16,500 consecutive thyroid operations with 30,000 operated sites that have been prospectively documented in the German Thyroid Multicenter Study performed 1998 through 2001. Quality of surgery were analyzed by calculating the inverse relationship between volume and outcome (complication rate). To achieve complication rates (permanent unilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis and hypocalcemia) of<1 % (primary surgery) or<3 % (redo surgery) the minimum number of thyroid operations of lower level of experience (e. g. benign nodular goiter) per year was n=30. The minimum number of operations with higher level of experience was significantly lower (n=3-12) due to the higher level of experience of operating surgeons. In contrast to the rates of postoperative hypocalcemia the rates of postoperative recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis was clearly related to the number of thyroid operations performed.\nQuestion: Thyroid surgery: generalist or specialist?", "gt": "The high number of thyroid operations in Germany with about 20 % of operations of high level experience are requiring surgical curricula and hospital structures that offer as well generalists as specialists to treat the broad spectrum of thyroid diseases accordingly.

Based on the context provided, the German Thyroid Multicenter Study, conducted from 1998 to 2001, offers some insights into the relationship between the volume of thyroid surgeries performed by a surgeon and the outcomes, particularly in terms of complication rates.\n\nThe study analyzed 16,500 consecutive thyroid operations with 30,000 operated sites, focusing on the quality of surgery by calculating the inverse relationship between the volume of surgeries performed and the outcome, specifically looking at complications such as permanent unilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis and hypocalcemia.\n\nThe findings suggest that to achieve complication rates of less than 1% for primary surgery and less than 3% for redo surgery, surgeons need to perform a certain minimum number of thyroid operations per year. For procedures requiring a lower level of experience, such as benign nodular goiter surgery, the minimum number of surgeries needed per year to achieve these complication rates was found to be 30. For more complex cases requiring a higher level of experience, the minimum number needed was significantly lower (3-12 surgeries per year).\n\nThis implies that surgeons with a higher volume of thyroid surgeries tend to have better outcomes, especially in more complex cases, which supports the notion that specialists who focus on thyroid surgery might generally achieve better results. However, the study also indicates that generalists, if they perform a sufficient number of thyroid surgeries per year, can also achieve low complication rates.\n\nIn summary, while specialists might have an advantage due to their focused expertise and higher surgical volumes, the data suggest that generalists can also perform thyroid surgery with low complication rates if they maintain a high enough volume of these procedures. The key appears to be the experience and volume of surgeries performed, rather than the generalist or specialist status alone."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: To investigate the discrepancies between outcomes for competence (can do) and actual performance (do do) in activities of daily living (ADLs). Baseline measurements of a population-based follow-up study. Leiden 85-Plus Study, the Netherlands. Five hundred and ninety-nine persons, age 85. The response rate was 86%. Face-to-face interviews. Measurements of competence and actual performance were based on the Groningen Activity Restriction Scale. Help received was assessed for several domains. Prevalence rates for disability were assessed according to the concepts of both competence and actual performance. Analysis was performed separately for basic activities of daily living (BADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). Seventy-seven percent of the oldest old were competent to perform all the BADLs and performed them regularly. Fifteen percent were not competent to perform certain BADLs independently but performed them regularly with help from others. The prevalence of disability defined as inability in one or more BADLs was 22% for women and 10% for men. The prevalence of disability defined as inactivity in one or more BADLs was 16% for women and 17% for men. Only 5% of the oldest old were competent to perform all IADLs and performed them regularly. In spite of being competent, 70% did not perform certain IADLs regularly. The prevalence of disability defined as inability in one or more IADLs was 64% for women and 55% for men. The prevalence of disability defined as inactivity in one or more IADLs was 92% for women and 98% for men.\nQuestion: Disability in the oldest old: \"can do\" or \"do do\"?", "gt": "The structural discrepancies between the outcomes of competence and actual performance have important consequences when estimating disability in old people.

However, a smaller percentage (15%) were not competent to perform certain BADLs independently but managed to perform them regularly with assistance from others. This indicates that while competence is a critical factor, actual performance can often be achieved through help from others, suggesting that disability defined by competence alone may not fully capture the actual functioning of the elderly.\n\nIn the case of IADLs, the disparity between competence and actual performance is even more pronounced. Only 5% of the oldest old were competent to perform all IADLs and did so regularly. Despite being competent, 70% did not perform certain IADLs regularly. This suggests that even when individuals are capable of performing these activities, they may not do so, possibly due to various factors such as lack of need, preference, or external assistance.\n\nThe prevalence rates of disability, when defined as inability to perform BADLs, were 22% for women and 10% for men, while defined as inactivity in BADLs, they were 16% for women and 17% for men. For IADLs, the disability rates were much higher, with 64% for women and 55% for men when defined by inability, and 92% for women and 98% for men when defined by inactivity.\n\nIn conclusion, the study underscores that disability in the oldest old is not merely a matter of \"can do\" (competence), but also involves the \"do do\" (actual performance). Both competence and actual performance are important dimensions to consider when assessing the functional status and disability in the elderly population. The data suggest that actual performance (do do) paints a more comprehensive picture of the functional abilities and limitations in the oldest old."}
{"query": "Answer the question based on the following context: Standard electrophysiologic techniques generally allow discrimination among mechanisms of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the response of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia to atrial and ventricular overdrive pacing can help determine the tachycardia mechanism. Fifty-three patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia were studied. Twenty-two patients had the typical form of atrioventricular (AV) junctional (nodal) reentry, 18 patients had orthodromic AV reentrant tachycardia, 10 patients had atrial tachycardia, and 3 patients had the atypical form of AV nodal reentrant tachycardia. After paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia was induced, 15-beat trains were introduced in the high right atrium and right ventricular apex sequentially with cycle lengths beginning 10 msec shorter than the spontaneous tachycardia cycle length. The pacing cycle length was shortened in successive trains until a cycle of 200 msec was reached or until tachycardia was terminated. Several responses of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia to overdrive pacing were useful in distinguishing atrial tachycardia from other mechanisms of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. During decremental atrial overdrive pacing, the curve relating the pacing cycle length to the VA interval on the first beat following the cessation of atrial pacing was flat or upsloping in patients with AV junctional reentry or AV reentrant tachycardia, but variable in patients with atrial tachycardia. AV reentry and AV junctional reentry could always be terminated by overdrive ventricular pacing whereas atrial tachycardia was terminated in only one of ten patients (P<0.001). The curve relating the ventricular pacing cycle length to the VA interval on the first postpacing beat was flat or upsloping in patients with AV junctional reentry and AV reentry, but variable in patients with atrial tachycardia. The typical form of AV junctional reentry could occasionally be distinguished from other forms of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia by the shortening of the AH interval following tachycardia termination during constant rate atrial pacing.\nQuestion: The response of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia to overdrive atrial and ventricular pacing: can it help determine the tachycardia mechanism?", "gt": "Atrial and ventricular overdrive pacing can rapidly and reliably distinguish atrial tachycardia from other mechanisms of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and occasionally assist in the diagnosis of other tachycardia mechanisms.

This relationship was found to be flat or upsloping in patients with AV junctional reentry or orthodromic AV reentrant tachycardia, whereas it was more variable in patients with atrial tachycardia.\n\n2. **Response to Ventricular Overdrive Pacing:** AV reentry and AV junctional reentry tachycardias were always terminated by overdrive ventricular pacing, whereas atrial tachycardia was only terminated in one out of ten patients. This significant difference (P<0.001) suggests that the response to ventricular overdrive pacing can help differentiate atrial tachycardia from AV junctional and AV reentrant tachycardias.\n\n3. **Curve Relating Ventricular Pacing Cycle Length to VA Interval:** Similar to the atrial overdrive pacing, the curve relating the ventricular pacing cycle length to the VA interval on the first post-pacing beat was flat or upsloping in patients with AV junctional reentry and AV reentry, but variable in patients with atrial tachycardia.\n\n4. **Shortening of the AH Interval:** The typical form of AV junctional reentry could be distinguished from other PSVT mechanisms by the shortening of the AH interval following tachycardia termination during constant rate atrial pacing.\n\nThese findings indicate that overdrive pacing can provide valuable information to help differentiate between different mechanisms of PSVT, aiding in the diagnosis and management of these arrhythmias."}

All patients with a diagnosis of congenital hydrocephalus were included in the study. In group 1, the lower end of the VPS was placed in the suprahepatic space. Patients were evaluated for abdominal complications like pseudocyst formation, intestinal obstruction and blockage of the lower end of the VPS. The data were compared with those patients in whom the peritoneal end was placed in the general peritoneal cavity (group 2). The total number of patients in groups 1 and 2 was 133 and 175, respectively. Complications in group 1 were dislodgement of the shunt in the general peritoneal cavity in 28 (21.05%), suprahepatic pseudocyst formation in 2 (1.5%) and blocked lower end in 2 patients (1.5%).
